subject re genocid is caus by theism evid to benedikt roseneau in articl qv at fb horu ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp frank o dwyer write the inform of that is invari under your child be a son or a daughter and sing about santa clau wasn t your argument that there ha to be more more than what more than we assum which is what exactli a most of the peopl i debat disagre with my premis hardli debat otherwis your favorit point that we sens so it hs to be there ha been challeng more than onc when i did it you said good question and did not address it i ve address it your caricatur is not my favourit point needless to sai at length in a previou out and am current discuss it with eric rescorla b there s littl point in respond the same point everywher i do my best to give everyon the courtesi of a repli you still repeat that point i do curiou sinc i believ that wa the first time i ve ever made it not that repetit would impli much more than your seem inabl to understand you ask me the same question i ll give you the same answer especi when in thi case i know the answer to be true i do my best to give everyon the courtesi of a repli but if everyon is make the same point and i m push for time then i try to respond what i believ ar the strongest formul of those point if that doesn t includ your post tough thi is usenet and life is tough all over c sinc there s a great deal of respons thi isn t alwai feasibl i do my best to honestli answer question put to me you drop out of debat with some poster and continu with other you appear with the same issu everi n month and start the dicuss at the begin again i ve onli debat thi issu twice in a a and occasion in t a the first wa in respons to simon clippingdal s posit assert that disagr about moral valu inexor acknowledg that moral ar rel it doesn t now simon ha drop out of the debat for some time i take that to mean that he is either busi or bore with the topic i certainli do not accus him of dishonesti do you d i can t alwai understand what you sai neither can t i understand you all the time usual on ask what the other side mean usual on doe usual you re clear but sometim you aren t and i ask you what you mean other time you seem to get extrem uptight and i feel that i m debat against line nois sometim i get tire and sometim i have other thing i d rather do again thi is usenet and life is tough all over you re go to have to deal with it e you re start to get person insult i mai not even put your name in the hat in futur that s suppos to be a threat no that s a simpl statement and an assert that i am not answer to those who offer me baseless insult for exampl those who accus me of ly about my person belief while also complain that i don t answer their question like that you what you sens is evid for the sens to be there if onli everyth would be so easi what almost everyon sens is evid for the sens to be there becaus to all intent and purpos it is there we had that argument for on your claim that everyon sens it is not found and you have been ask to give evid for it often and then the correct statement would be it is reason to assum that it is there unless evid against it ha been found i have no problem with the second statement i have provid an argument that almost everyon sens that freedom is valuabl the onli cogent object to thi came from jon livesei and wa offer by some other peopl too essenti that peopl disagre about fuzzi concept such as freedom it s a good point and i m think about it your trick is to sai i feel a is not right and so do mani i know therefor a is absolut right it neglect the possibl that these peopl consid a to be right as an effect of the same process restrict the claim of it absolut to those who have been subject of that process in other word refut it you make the ontolog claim you have to prove it nonsens my trick is to sai i feel that a is better than b and so doe almost ani disinterest person i ask best evid is therefor that a realli is better than b subject to the assumpt that we can establish to our mutual satisfact what we mean by a and b and that the result system of valu is self consist now get thi realli is better is an idealis a fiction model in the same sens that real materi exist is a fiction model it mai or mai not correspond to someth true it is nonetheless a us assumpt far more us than the equal assum relativist trick to wit i feel that a is better than b and so doe almost ani disinterest person i ask howev if even on person disagre that a is better than b or if even on person dissent from mutual agre definit of a and b then it is the case that b is better than a for that person and noth more can be said i sai thi is useless becaus it inexor impli that a supermajor seek to maximis a cannot moral take action against someon seek to maximis b e g a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajor s carefulli consid moral would be better than the terrorist s which would of cours be true but a no no for an ethic relativist to claim that ethic relativ impli anyth els is simpli weasel word and an exampl of compartmentalis to rival anyth in the world of religion for a similar argument i sens moral is subject it doe not hurt me to do thing that ar consid to be object wrong by other if you mean that you do thing that some other consid object wrong and it turn out not to be the case for you of cours thi is possibl it is neither evid for subjectiv nor evid against objectiv except sometim in a pragmat sens it serv as a counterexampl for that everyth that is subject to judgement is absolut and as long as you don t provid evid for that there is someth univers agre upon there is no reason to believ your hypothesi i ve done thi freedom with the proviso that i still have to answer jon s object that fuzzi concept like freedom have no object mean further in order to make moral absolut univers or object you would have to show that it is independ of human or the attribut abov look quit mislead not realli what evid is there that anyth exist independ of human you ll be hard press to find ani that isn t logic equival when appli to valu an analog set of premis would be premis some peopl believ that object speak the shortest rout from my hous to a bar is through the main entranc of the estat and down the malahid road premis i check it out and found that the shortest rout from my which is much closer you would never deduc from these that there is no shortest rout from my hous to a bar yet that is seemingli how you deriv your relativist claim us premis which ar logic no differ no moral ar a matter of belief so far the peopl still believ that the shortest wai is through the main entranc no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analog you would have to show that there is a shortest wai and that there is a method to convinc everyon of that it is the shortest wai inde in other word your analog work onli when on assum that your premis ar right in the first place if not it is a fallaci and if thi were an argument for objectiv you d be right it isn t though it s a demonstr that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectiv nor argument for relativ your gimmick is to assum in the first place that valu aren t real and to us thi to prove that valu aren t real in other word you beg the question against me frank o dwyer i m not hatch that odwyer sse ie
