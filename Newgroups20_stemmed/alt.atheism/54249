subject free energi technolog free energi technolog by robert e mcelwain physicist nineti to a hundr year ago everybodi knew that a heavier than air machin could not possibl fly it would violat the law of physic all of the expert and author said so for exampl simon newcomb declar in the demonstr that no possibl combin of known substanc known form of machineri and known form of forc can be unit in a practic machin by which man shall fly long distanc through the air seem to the writer as complet as it is possibl for the demonstr of ani physic fact to be fortun a few smart peopl such as the wright brother did not accept such pronounc as the final word now we take airplan for grant except when thei crash todai orthodox physicist and other scientist ar sai similar thing against sever kind of free energi technolog us neg term such as pseudo scienc and perpetu motion and cite so call law which assert that energi cannot be creat or destroi st law of thermodynam and there is alwai a decreas in us energi nd law of thermodynam the physicist do not know how to do certain thing so thei arrogantli declar that those thing cannot be done such principl of impot ar common in orthodox modern scienc and help to cover up inconsist and contradict in orthodox modern theori free energi invent ar devic which can tap a seemingli unlimit suppli of energi from the univers with out burn ani kind of fuel make them the perfect solut to the world wide energi crisi and it associ pollut degrad and deplet of the environ most free energi devic probabl do not creat energi but rather tap into exist natur energi sourc by variou form of induct unlik solar or wind devic thei need littl or no energi storag capac becaus thei can tap as much energi as need when need solar energi ha the di advantag that the sun is often block by cloud tree build or the earth itself or is reduc by haze or smog or by thick atmospher at low altitud and high latitud likewis wind speed is wide variabl and often non exist neither solar nor wind power ar suitabl to directli power car and airplan properli design free energi devic do not have such limit for exampl at least three u s patent and have so far been award for motor that run exclus on perman magnet seemingli tap into energi circul through the earth s magnet field the first two requir a feedback network in order to be self run the third on as describ in detail in scienc mechan magazin spring amaz magnet power motor by jorma hyypia page and front cover requir critic size shape orient and space of magnet but no feedback such a motor could drive an electr gener or revers heatpump in on s home year round for free complet descript copi of u s patent ar each from the u s patent offic jefferson davi hwy arlington va correct digit patent number requir or try get copi of both the articl and the patent via your local public or univers librari s inter librari loan dept a second type of free energi devic such as the grai motor u s patent the tesla coil and the motor of inventor joseph newman see scienc page tap electro magnet energi by induct from earth reson about cycl per second plu harmon thei typic have a spark gap in the circuit which serv to synchron the energi in the coil with the energi be tap it is import that the total induct and capacit of the devic combin to reson at the same frequenc as earth reson in order to maxim the power output thi output can also be increas by center the spark gap at the neutral center of a strong u shape perman magnet in the case of a tesla coil slip a toroid choke coil around the secondari coil will enhanc output power earth energi fuelless propuls power system by john bigelow health research p o box mokelumn hill ca dure the s an austrian civil engin name viktor schauberg invent and partial develop an implos turbin german name zokwendl after analyz eros and lack of eros in differ shape waterwai and develop sophist mathemat equat to explain it as describ in the book a breakthrough to new free energi sourc by dan a davidson water is pump by an impel pump through a logarithm spiral shape coil of tube until it reach a critic veloc the water then implod no longer touch the insid wall of the tube and drive the pump which then convert the pump s motor into an electr gener the devic seem to be tap energi from that of the earth s rotat via the corioli effect like a tornado it can also neutral graviti a fourth type of free energi devic is the mcclintock air motor u s patent which is a cross between a diesel engin it ha three cylind with a compress ratio of to and a rotari engin with solar and planetari gear it burn no fuel but becom self run by drive it own air compressor thi engin also gener a lot of heat which could be us to heat build and it veri high torqu make it ideal for larg truck prevent their slow down when climb hill david mcclintock is also the real origin inventor of the automat transmiss differenti and wheel drive crystal mai somedai be us to suppli energi as shown in the star trek show perhap by insert each on between metal capacitor plate and bombard it with a beam of particl from a small radioact sourc like that us in a common household smoke detector on other energi sourc should be mention here despit the fact that it doe not fit the definit of free energi a bulgarian born american physicist name joseph maglich ha invent and partial develop an atom fusion reactor which he call migma which us non radioact deuterium as a fuel avail in nearli unlimit quantiti from sea water doe not produc radioact wast can be convert directli into electr with out energi wast steam turbin and can be construct small enough to power a hous or larg enough to power a citi and unlik the tokamak and laser fusion monstros that we read about migma work alreadi produc at least three watt of power for everi watt put in new time u s version page and then there ar the cold fusion experi that have been in the new late origin conduct by univers of utah research b stanlei pon and martin fleischmann some u s navi research at the china lake naval weapon center in california under the direct of chemist melvin mile final took the troubl to collect the bubbl come from such an apparatu had them analyz with mass spectrometri techniqu and found helium which prove that atom fusion did inde take place and enough of it to explain the excess heat gener there ar good indic that the two so call law of thermodynam ar not so absolut for exampl the late physicist dewei b larson develop a comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers which he call the reciproc system which he describ in detail in sever book such as noth but motion and the univers of motion in which the physic univers ha two distinct halv the materi half and an anti matter half with a continu cycl of matter and energi pass between them with out the heat death predict by thermodynam law hi theori explain the univers much better than modern orthodox theori includ phenomena that orthodox physicist and astronom ar still scratch their head about and is self consist in everi wai some free energi devic might be tap into that energi flow seemingli convert low qualiti energi into high qualiti energi also certain religi organ such as sant mat and eckankar teach their member that the physic univers is onli the lowest of at least a dozen major level of exist like parallel univers or analog to tv channel as describ in book like the path of the master by dr julian johnson and eckankar the kei to secret world by sri paul twitchel for exampl the next level up from the physic univers is commonli call the astral plane long time member of these group have learn to soul travel into these higher world and report on condit there it seem plausibl that energi could flow down from these higher level into the physic univers or be creat at the boundari between them given the right configur of matter to channel it thi is support by mani success laboratori control experi in psycho kinesi throughout the world such as those describ in the book psychic discoveri behind the iron curtain in term of econom the market ha fail inventor do not have enough monei and other resourc to fulli develop and mass produc free energi equip and the convent energi produc have no desir to do so becaus of their ve ted inter t the govern is need to interven if the govern doe not interven then the total suppli of energi resourc from the earth will continu to declin and will soon run out price for energi will increas and pollut and it harm effect includ the greenhous effect acid rain smog radioact contamin oil spill rape of the land by strip mine etc will continu to increas the govern should subsid research and develop of free energi by inventor and univers subsid privat product until the produc can make it on their own and subsid consumpt by low incom consum of free energi hardwar the long rang effect of such govern intervent would be wide spread and profound the quantiti of energi demand from convent energi produc coal mine compani oil compani and countri electr utiliti etc would drop to near zero forc their employe to seek work elsewher energi resourc coal uranium oil and ga would be left in the ground price for convent energi suppli would also drop to near zero while the price of free energi equip would start out high but drop as suppli increas as happen with vcr s person comput etc cost of produc product that requir larg quantiti of energi to produc would decreas along with their price to consum consum would be abl to realiz the opportun cost of pai electr util bill or bui home heat fuel tourism would benefit and increas becaus travel would not have to spend their monei for gasolin for their car govern tax revenu from gasolin and other fuel would have to be obtain in some other wai and energi could no longer be us as a motiv or excus for make war mani convent energi produc would go out of busi but societi as a whole and the earth s environ and ecosystem would benefit greatli it is the peopl that govern should serv rather than the big corpor and bank for more inform answer to your question etc pleas consult my cite sourc patent
