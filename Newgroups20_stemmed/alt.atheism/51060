manti co uk thi articl attempt to provid a gener introduct to atheism whilst i have tri to be as neutral as possibl regard contenti issu you should alwai rememb that thi document repres onli on viewpoint i would encourag you to read wide and draw your own conclus some relev book ar list in a companion articl to provid a sens of cohes and progress i have present thi articl as an imaginari convers between an atheist and a theist all the question ask by the imaginari theist ar question which have been crop up repeatedli on alt atheism sinc the newsgroup wa creat some other frequent ask question ar answer in a companion articl pleas note that thi articl is arguabl slant toward answer question pose from a christian viewpoint thi is becaus the faq file reflect question which have actual been ask and it is predominantli christian who proselyt on alt atheism so when i talk of religion i am talk primarili about religion such as christian judaism and islam which involv some sort of superhuman divin be much of the discuss will appli to other religion but some of it mai not what is atheism atheism is character by an absenc of belief in the exist of god some atheist go further and believ that god doe not exist the former is often refer to as the weak atheist posit and the latter as strong atheism it is import to note the differ between these two posit weak atheism is simpl sceptic disbelief in the exist of god strong atheism is a posit belief that god doe not exist pleas do not fall into the trap of assum that all atheist ar strong atheist some atheist believ in the non exist of all god other limit their atheism to specif god such as the christian god rather than make flat out denial but isn t disbeliev in god the same thing as believ he doesn t exist definit not disbelief in a proposit mean that on doe not believ it to be true not believ that someth is true is not equival to believ that it is fals on mai simpli have no idea whether it is true or not which bring us to agnostic what is agnostic then the term agnostic wa coin by professor huxlei at a meet of the metaphys societi in he defin an agnost as someon who disclaim strong atheism and believ that the ultim origin of thing must be some caus unknown and unknow thu an agnost is someon who believ that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god exist word ar slipperi thing and languag is inexact bewar of assum that you can work out someon s philosoph point of view simpli from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnost for exampl mani peopl us agnostic to mean weak atheism and us the word atheism onli when refer to strong atheism bewar also that becaus the word atheist ha so mani shade of mean it is veri difficult to gener about atheist about all you can sai for sure is that atheist don t believ in god for exampl it certainli isn t the case that all atheist believ that scienc is the best wai to find out about the univers so what is the philosoph justif or basi for atheism there ar mani philosoph justif for atheism to find out why a particular person choos to be an atheist it s best to ask her mani atheist feel that the idea of god as present by the major religion is essenti self contradictori and that it is logic imposs that such a god could exist other ar atheist through sceptic becaus thei see no evid that god exist but isn t it imposs to prove the non exist of someth there ar mani counter exampl to such a statement for exampl it is quit simpl to prove that there doe not exist a prime number larger than all other prime number of cours thi deal with well defin object obei well defin rule whether god or univers ar similarli well defin is a matter for debat howev assum for the moment that the exist of a god is not provabl imposs there ar still subtl reason for assum the non exist of god if we assum that someth doe not exist it is alwai possibl to show that thi assumpt is invalid by find a singl counter exampl if on the other hand we assum that someth doe exist and if the thing in question is not provabl imposs show that the assumpt is invalid mai requir an exhaust search of all possibl place where such a thing might be found to show that it isn t there such an exhaust search is often impract or imposs there is no such problem with largest prime becaus we can prove that thei don t exist therefor it is gener accept that we must assum thing do not exist unless we have evid that thei do even theist follow thi rule most of the time thei don t believ in unicorn even though thei can t conclus prove that no unicorn exist anywher to assum that god exist is to make an assumpt which probabl cannot be test we cannot make an exhaust search of everywher god might be to prove that he doesn t exist anywher so the sceptic atheist assum by default that god doe not exist sinc that is an assumpt we can test those who profess strong atheism usual do not claim that no sort of god exist instead thei gener restrict their claim so as to cover varieti of god describ by follow of variou religion so whilst it mai be imposs to prove conclus that no god exist it mai be possibl to prove that sai a god as describ by a particular religi book doe not exist it mai even be possibl to prove that no god describ by ani present dai religion exist in practic believ that no god describ by ani religion exist is veri close to believ that no god exist howev it is suffici differ that counter argument base on the imposs of disprov everi kind of god ar not realli applic but what if god is essenti non detect if god interact with our univers in ani wai the effect of hi interact must be measur henc hi interact with our univers must be detect if god is essenti non detect it must therefor be the case that he doe not interact with our univers in ani wai mani atheist would argu that if god doe not interact with our univers at all it is of no import whether he exist or not if the bibl is to be believ god wa easili detect by the israelit sure he should still be detect todai note that i am not demand that god interact in a scientif verifi physic wai it must sure be possibl to perceiv some effect caus by hi presenc though otherwis how can i distinguish him from all the other thing that don t exist ok you mai think there s a philosoph justif for atheism but isn t it still a religi belief on of the most common pastim in philosoph discuss is the redefinit game the cynic view of thi game is as follow person a begin by make a contenti statement when person b point out that it can t be true person a gradual re defin the word he us in the statement until he arriv at someth person b is prepar to accept he then record the statement along with the fact that person b ha agre to it and continu eventu a us the statement as an agre fact but us hi origin definit of all the word in it rather than the obscur redefinit origin need to get b to agre to it rather than be seen to be appar inconsist b will tend to plai along the point of thi digress is that the answer to the question isn t atheism a religi belief depend crucial upon what is meant by religi religion is gener character by belief in a superhuman control power especi in some sort of god and by faith and worship it s worth point out in pass that some varieti of buddhism ar not religion accord to such a definit atheism is certainli not a belief in ani sort of superhuman power nor is it categor by worship in ani meaning sens widen the definit of religi to encompass atheism tend to result in mani other aspect of human behaviour suddenli becom class as religi as well such as scienc polit and watch tv ok so it s not a religion but sure belief in atheism or scienc is still just an act of faith like religion is firstli it s not entir clear that sceptic atheism is someth on actual believ in secondli it is necessari to adopt a number of core belief or assumpt to make some sort of sens out of the sensori data we experi most atheist try to adopt as few core belief as possibl and even those ar subject to question if experi throw them into doubt scienc ha a number of core assumpt for exampl it is gener assum that the law of physic ar the same for all observ these ar the sort of core assumpt atheist make if such basic idea ar call act of faith then almost everyth we know must be said to be base on act of faith and the term lose it mean faith is more often us to refer to complet certain belief in someth accord to such a definit atheism and scienc ar certainli not act of faith of cours individu atheist or scientist can be as dogmat as religi follow when claim that someth is certain thi is not a gener tendenc howev there ar mani atheist who would be reluct to state with certainti that the univers exist faith is also us to refer to belief without support evid or proof sceptic atheism certainli doesn t fit that definit as sceptic atheism ha no belief strong atheism is closer but still doesn t realli match as even the most dogmat atheist will tend to refer to experiment data or the lack of it when assert that god doe not exist if atheism is not religi sure it s anti religi it is an unfortun human tendenc to label everyon as either for or against friend or enemi the truth is not so clear cut atheism is the posit that run logic counter to theism in that sens it can be said to be anti religion howev when religi believ speak of atheist be anti religi thei usual mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathi or hatr toward theist thi categor of atheist as hostil toward religion is quit unfair atheist attitud toward theist in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheist take a live and let live attitud unless question thei will not usual mention their atheism except perhap to close friend of cours thi mai be in part becaus atheism is not social accept in mani countri a few atheist ar quit anti religi and mai even try to convert other when possibl histor such anti religi atheist have made littl impact on societi outsid the eastern bloc countri to digress slightli the soviet union wa origin dedic to separ of church and state just like the usa soviet citizen were legal free to worship as thei wish the institut of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tri to destroi the church in order to gain complet power over the popul some atheist ar quit vocal about their belief but onli where thei see religion encroach on matter which ar not it busi for exampl the govern of the usa such individu ar usual concern that church and state should remain separ but if you don t allow religion to have a sai in the run of the state sure that s the same as state atheism the principl of the separ of church and state is that the state shall not legisl concern matter of religi belief in particular it mean not onli that the state cannot promot on religion at the expens of anoth but also that it cannot promot ani belief which is religi in natur religion can still have a sai in discuss of pure secular matter for exampl religi believ have histor been respons for encourag mani polit reform even todai mani organ campaign for an increas in spend on foreign aid ar found as religi campaign so long as thei campaign concern secular matter and so long as thei do not discrimin on religi ground most atheist ar quit happi to see them have their sai what about prayer in school if there s no god why do you care if peopl prai becaus peopl who do prai ar voter and lawmak and tend to do thing that those who don t prai can t just ignor also christian prayer in school is intimid to non christian even if thei ar told that thei need not join in the divers of religi and non religi belief mean that it is imposs to formul a meaning prayer that will be accept to all those present at ani public event also non prayer tend to have friend and famili who prai it is reason to care about friend and famili wast their time even without other motiv you mention christian who campaign for increas foreign aid what about atheist why aren t there ani atheist chariti or hospit don t atheist object to the religi chariti there ar mani chariti without religi purpos that atheist can contribut to some atheist contribut to religi chariti as well for the sake of the practic good thei do some atheist even do voluntari work for chariti found on a theistic basi most atheist seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shout about in connect with chariti to them atheism is just a simpl obviou everydai matter and so is chariti mani feel that it s somewhat cheap not to sai self righteou to us simpl chariti as an excus to plug a particular set of religi belief to weak atheist build a hospit to sai i do not believ in god is a rather strang idea it s rather like hold a parti to sai todai is not my birthdai why the fuss atheism is rare evangel you said atheism isn t anti religi but is it perhap a backlash against on s upbring a wai of rebel perhap it is for some but mani peopl have parent who do not attempt to forc ani religi or atheist idea upon them and mani of those peopl choos to call themselv atheist it s also doubtless the case that some religi peopl chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbring as a wai of be differ on the other hand mani peopl choos religion as a wai of conform to the expect of other on the whole we can t conclud much about whether atheism or religion ar backlash or conform although in gener peopl have a tendenc to go along with a group rather than act or think independ how do atheist differ from religi peopl thei don t believ in god that s all there is to it atheist mai listen to heavi metal backward even or thei mai prefer a verdi requiem even if thei know the word thei mai wear hawaiian shirt thei mai dress all in black thei mai even wear orang robe mani buddhist lack a belief in ani sort of god some atheist even carri a copi of the bibl around for argu against of cours whoever you ar the chanc ar you have met sever atheist without realis it atheist ar usual unexcept in behaviour and appear unexcept but aren t atheist less moral than religi peopl that depend if you defin moral as obedi to god then of cours atheist ar less moral as thei don t obei ani god but usual when on talk of moral on talk of what is accept right and unaccept wrong behaviour within societi human ar social anim and to be maxim success thei must co oper with each other thi is a good enough reason to discourag most atheist from anti social or immor behaviour pure for the purpos of self preserv mani atheist behav in a moral or compassion wai simpli becaus thei feel a natur tendenc to empath with other human so why do thei care what happen to other thei don t know thei simpli ar that wai natur there ar some peopl who behav immor and try to us atheism to justifi their action howev there ar equal mani peopl who behav immor and then try to us religi belief to justifi their action for exampl here is a trustworthi sai that deserv full accept jesu christ came into the world to save sinner but for that veri reason i wa shown merci so that in me jesu christ might displai hi unlimit patienc as an exampl for those who would believ in him and receiv etern life now to the king etern immort invis the onli god be honor and glori forev and ever the abov quot is from a statement made to the court on februari th by jeffrei dahmer the notori cannib serial killer of milwauke wisconsin it seem that for everi atheist mass murder there is a religi mass murder but what of more trivial moral a survei conduct by the roper organ found that behavior deterior after born again experi while onli of respond said thei had driven intox befor be born again had done so after convers similarli had us illeg drug befor convers after two percent admit to engag in illicit sex befor salvat after freethought todai septemb p so it seem that at best religion doe not have a monopoli on moral behaviour is there such a thing as atheist moral if you mean is there such a thing as moral for atheist then the answer is ye as explain abov mani atheist have idea about moral which ar at least as strong as those held by religi peopl if you mean doe atheism have a characterist moral code then the answer is no atheism by itself doe not impli anyth much about how a person will behav most atheist follow mani of the same moral rule as theist but for differ reason atheist view moral as someth creat by human accord to the wai human feel the world ought to work rather than see it as a set of rule decre by a supernatur be then aren t atheist just theist who ar deni god a studi by the freedom from religion foundat found that over of the atheist who respond becam atheist becaus religion did not work for them thei had found that religi belief were fundament incompat with what thei observ around them atheist ar not unbeliev through ignor or denial thei ar unbeliev through choic the vast major of them have spent time studi on or more religion sometim in veri great depth thei have made a care and consid decis to reject religi belief thi decis mai of cours be an inevit consequ of that individu s person for a natur sceptic person the choic of atheism is often the onli on that make sens and henc the onli choic that person can honestli make but don t atheist want to believ in god atheist live their live as though there is nobodi watch over them mani of them have no desir to be watch over no matter how good natur the big brother figur might be some atheist would like to be abl to believ in god but so what should on believ thing mere becaus on want them to be true the risk of such an approach should be obviou atheist often decid that want to believ someth is not enough there must be evid for the belief but of cours atheist see no evid for the exist of god thei ar unwil in their soul to see mani if not most atheist were previous religi as ha been explain abov the vast major have serious consid the possibl that god exist mani atheist have spent time in prayer try to reach god of cours it is true that some atheist lack an open mind but assum that all atheist ar bias and insincer is offens and close mind comment such as of cours god is there you just aren t look properli ar like to be view as patron certainli if you wish to engag in philosoph debat with atheist it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assum that thei ar be sincer if thei sai that thei have search for god if you ar not will to believ that thei ar basic tell the truth debat is futil isn t the whole of life complet pointless to an atheist mani atheist live a purpos life thei decid what thei think give mean to life and thei pursu those goal thei try to make their live count not by wish for etern life but by have an influenc on other peopl who will live on for exampl an atheist mai dedic hi life to polit reform in the hope of leav hi mark on histori it is a natur human tendenc to look for mean or purpos in random event howev it is by no mean obviou that life is the sort of thing that ha a mean to put it anoth wai not everyth which look like a question is actual a sensibl thing to ask some atheist believ that ask what is the mean of life is as silli as ask what is the mean of a cup of coffe thei believ that life ha no purpos or mean it just is so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger there ar mani wai of obtain comfort from famili friend or even pet or on a less spiritu level from food or drink or tv that mai sound rather an empti and vulner wai to face danger but so what should individu believ in thing becaus thei ar comfort or should thei face realiti no matter how harsh it might be in the end it s a decis for the individu concern most atheist ar unabl to believ someth thei would not otherwis believ mere becaus it make them feel comfort thei put truth befor comfort and consid that if search for truth sometim make them feel unhappi that s just hard luck don t atheist worri that thei might suddenli be shown to be wrong the short answer is no do you mani atheist have been atheist for year thei have encount mani argument and much suppos evid for the exist of god but thei have found all of it to be invalid or inconclus thousand of year of religi belief haven t result in ani good proof of the exist of god atheist therefor tend to feel that thei ar unlik to be prove wrong in the immedi futur and thei stop worri about it so why should theist question their belief don t the same argument appli no becaus the belief be question ar not similar weak atheism is the sceptic default posit to take it assert noth strong atheism is a neg belief theism is a veri strong posit belief atheist sometim also argu that theist should question their belief becaus of the veri real harm thei can caus not just to the believ but to everyon els what sort of harm religion repres a huge financi and work burden on mankind it s not just a matter of religi believ wast their monei on church build think of all the time and effort spent build church prai and so on imagin how that effort could be better spent mani theist believ in miracl heal there have been plenti of instanc of ill peopl be heal by a priest ceas to take the medicin prescrib to them by doctor and dy as a result some theist have di becaus thei have refus blood transfus on religi ground it is arguabl that the cathol church s opposit to birth control and condom in particular is increas the problem of overpopul in mani third world countri and contribut to the spread of aid world wide religi believ have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to becom atheist or marri someon of a differ religion those weren t real believ thei just claim to be believ as some sort of excus what make a real believ there ar so mani on true religion it s hard to tell look at christian there ar mani compet group all convinc that thei ar the onli true christian sometim thei even fight and kill each other how is an atheist suppos to decid who s a real christian and who isn t when even the major christian church like the cathol church and the church of england can t decid amongst themselv in the end most atheist take a pragmat view and decid that anyon who call himself a christian and us christian belief or dogma to justifi hi action should be consid a christian mayb some of those christian ar just pervert christian teach for their own end but sure if the bibl can be so readili us to support un christian act it can t be much of a moral code if the bibl is the word of god why couldn t he have made it less easi to misinterpret and how do you know that your belief aren t a pervers of what your god intend if there is no singl unambigu interpret of the bibl then why should an atheist take on interpret over anoth just on your sai so sorri but if someon claim that he believ in jesu and that he murder other becaus jesu and the bibl told him to do so we must call him a christian obvious those extrem sort of belief should be question but sinc nobodi ha ever prove that god doe not exist it must be veri unlik that more basic religi belief share by all faith ar nonsens that doe not hold becaus as wa point out at the start of thi dialogu posit assert concern the exist of entiti ar inher much harder to disprov than neg on nobodi ha ever prove that unicorn don t exist but that doesn t make it unlik that thei ar myth it is therefor much more valid to hold a neg assert by default than it is to hold a posit assert by default of cours weak atheist would argu that assert noth is better still well if atheism s so great why ar there so mani theist unfortun the popular of a belief ha littl to do with how correct it is or whether it work consid how mani peopl believ in astrolog grapholog and other pseudo scienc mani atheist feel that it is simpli a human weak to want to believ in god certainli in mani primit human societi religion allow the peopl to deal with phenomena that thei do not adequ understand of cours there s more to religion than that in the industri world we find peopl believ in religi explan of phenomena even when there ar perfectli adequ natur explan religion mai have start as a mean of attempt to explain the world but nowadai it serv other purpos as well but so mani cultur have develop religion sure that must sai someth not realli most religion ar onli superfici similar for exampl it s worth rememb that religion such as buddhism and taoism lack ani sort of concept of god in the christian sens of cours most religion ar quick to denounc compet religion so it s rather odd to us on religion to try and justifi anoth what about all the famou scientist and philosoph who have conclud that god exist for everi scientist or philosoph who believ in a god there is on who doe not besid as ha alreadi been point out the truth of a belief is not determin by how mani peopl believ it also it is import to realiz that atheist do not view famou scientist or philosoph in the same wai that theist view their religi leader a famou scientist is onli human she mai be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carri no special weight mani respect scientist have made themselv look foolish by speak on subject which lie outsid their field of expertis so ar you realli sai that widespread belief in religion indic noth not entir it certainli indic that the religion in question ha properti which have help it so spread so far the theori of memet talk of meme set of idea which can propag themselv between human mind by analog with gene some atheist view religion as set of particularli success parasit meme which spread by encourag their host to convert other some meme avoid destruct by discourag believ from question doctrin or by us peer pressur to keep on time believ from admit that thei were mistaken some religi meme even encourag their host to destroi host control by other meme of cours in the memet view there is no particular virtu associ with success propag of a meme religion is not a good thing becaus of the number of peopl who believ it ani more than a diseas is a good thing becaus of the number of peopl who have caught it even if religion is not entir true at least it put across import messag what ar the fundament messag of atheism there ar mani import idea atheist promot the follow ar just a few of them don t be surpris to see idea which ar also present in some religion there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessli follow rule be especi sceptic of posit claim if you want your life to have some sort of mean it s up to you to find it search for what is true even if it make you uncomfort make the most of your life as it s probabl the onli on you ll have it s no good reli on some extern power to chang you you must chang yourself just becaus someth s popular doesn t mean it s good if you must assum someth assum someth it s easi to test don t believ thing just becaus you want them to be true and final and most importantli all belief should be open to question
