subject re is moral constant wa re biblic rape bill conner bil okcforum osrh edu wrote there ar a coupl of thing about your post and other in thi thread that ar a littl confus an atheist is on for whom all thing can be understood as process of natur exclus thi definit doe not includ all atheist see the faq howev i for on do think there is no need to invok ani divin or spiritu explan it make a big differ to claim that all thing can be understood as natur process and to claim that our observ do not requir us to postul ani divin intervent or anyth spiritu for that matter human ar not omnipot and neither is scienc howev scienc ha on advantag theologi doesn t it is self correct with natur as it judg it is delight to see how scientif inquiri is reveal a self consist simpl pictur of our univers scienc is no longer a bunch of separ branch it is on from particl physic to psycholog and no aspect of our life or our univers is safe from it stern and stoni ey not even our conscious there is no need for ani recours to divniti to describ or explain anyth there is no purpos or direct for ani event beyond those requir by physic chemistri biologi etc everyth is random noth is determnin actual determin vs indetermin is a philosoph question and scienc cannot sai whether the whole thing is actual somehow superdeterminist or not i think the question doe not have ani mean as far as individu human be go if their appar free will is an illus it doe not appear to be so from their perspect bill can you sai for sure whether you have a free will or not thi would also have to includ human intellig of cours and all it product there is noth requir that life evolv or that it acquir intellig it s just a happi accid mayb who ar we to tell it seem intellig is us when dure the histori of earth ha on speci been abl to control on third of the whole biospher thi can still be a result of numer happi accid our genet machineri blindli replic and preserv even that machineri can be result of the same principl onli the system that can start replic will surviv those which don t don t make it recommend read t o for an atheist no event can be prefer to anoth or be said to have more or less valu than anoth in ani naturalist sens and no thought about an event can have valu from whose perspect i valu event and thing subject from my perspect natur doe not have valu becaus it doe not have a perspect valu aris from awar if i have a subject perspect it is easi to assum that other peopl also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their posit i will eventu discov the golden rule moral is not necessarili a gift from heaven in fact it mai be a product of evolut perhap we ar awar of ourselv becaus a sens of ident is help allow us to plai the role of other and make us respect other who seem to have ident too bill have you ever read aristotl try hi ethica nikomakhea sp for starter how then can an atheist judg valu what is the basi for critic the valu ennumer in the bibl or the purpos imput to god on what ground can the the behavior of the reliogi be condemn it seem that in judg the valu that motiv other to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measur but what in natur can serv that purpos what law of natur can you invok to establish your valu c s lewi tell us that thi argument wa the main reason why he abandon hi atheism and becam christian the argument is sever flaw some valu such as the golden rule can have a ration basi some other like the basic idea of want to live ha probabl it root in the wai our brain ar wire lewi ignor the veri real possibl that natur select could also favour altruist behaviour and moral as well inde as human evolv better and better in build and us tool thei also becam better at kill each other it is a logic necess that evolut could onli favour those who knew how to us tool but not against on s own peopl the bibl reveal quit nice that the moral of the earli jew wa not beyond thi a simpl set of rule to hold the peopl togeth under on god their god did not care much about peopl of other nation at the time of the nt thing were quit differ the jew were under rule of an empir and could no longer simpli ignor the gentil a new situat requir a new moral and along with it a new religion wa born a mutat in a meme pool sinc everi event is entir and exclus a physic event what differ could it possibl make what anyon doe religi or otherwis there can be no mean or gradat of valu the onli wai an atheist can object to ani behaviour is to admit that the object is entir subject and that he she just doesn t like it that s it ani valu judgement must be prefac by the disclaim that it is noth more than a matter of person opinion and carri no weight in ani absolut sens it look like you haven t bother to read philosophi whenev there is an observ there is a subject point of view which mai valu it exist and happi even if that were just a result of some physic event and other s happi too if the observ come to think about it in an absolut object sens that is without ani observ or subject moral judgment lose their mean it is not possibl for a valu to simpli exist without a point of view thi includ god too their valu ar onli their person judgment not absolut truth sinc such truth do not exist the fact that most peopl do not deliber want to hurt other is a manifest of the wai we have fought for our exist by becom social be who can think and valu other exist moral is not properti of human alon chimp dolphin and mani other speci show great care for each other dolphin have sometim save human from drown a good deed inde that you don t like what god told peopl to do sai noth about god or god s command it sai onli that there wa an electr event in your nervou system that creat an emot state that your mind coupl with a pre exist thought set to form that reaction that your object seem well found is due to the wai you ve been condit there is no truth content the whole of your intellectu landscap is an illus a virtual realiti the last statement doe not logic follow in fact there is everi reason to believ our thought can model realiti veri well and our sens can convei reliabl inform solips is still a logic possibl but not a veri like on you ar continu mix two differ view the subject point of view which we all share and an object point of view which doe not exist ani observ or thinker ani person be ha it own point of view it doe not matter whether thi point of view is a result of some physic event or not it doe not ceas to be subject from a non observ non point of view valu do not exist neither doe pain or pleasur or beauti or love such thing ar inher subject onc again if god want wive to submit to their husband or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or want to punish us if we don t i disagre with hi moral i do not think my moral come from ani suprem be to remov my moral mean the same than to make me a zombi a machin without a singl thought if god gave us moral to judg but i disagre with him it is not my fault he is free to replac my moral i cannot see what is the point of give someon a moral system which disagre with on s own and then to get mad at thi god must be schizophren all of thi be so you have exclud yourself from ani discuss of valu right wrong goood evil etc and cannot particip your opinion about the bibl can have no weight whatsoev neither can the opinion of ani god for that matter i cannot understand why a subject opinion of a thing made of matter is in ani wai less credibl than an opinion of a thing made of someth els bill take note absolut valu must be independ of ani be includ god if god ha a subject viewpoint it is hi own point of view and hi moral ar hi own petri petri pihko kem pmp mathemat is the truth pihati c finou oulu fi physic
