subject re yet more rushdi re islam law in articl apr nic csu net davec silicon csci csusb edu dave chowel wrote in articl apr bnr ca rashid write stuff delet the point of my post wa that rushdi wa not be condemn sole for the word in hi book although thi wa certainli a contribut factor it wa the whole seri of action of rushdi and hi publish follow the public of the book and the initi media spotlight place on the book that in larg part led to the fatwa the kind of fatwa level against rushdi is not lightli place and there ar ani number of anti islam writer both within and outsid the islam world who have not had fatwa made against them here someon who add fuel to an explos situat might be charg with incit to riot if peopl die in the riot the charg against him might becom even more seriou how can rushdi be blame for the death of peopl who ar demonstr against him the death should be blame on the peopl who dealt with the demonstr or on the demonstr themselv if thei were violent to what length will you go to justifi thi barbar behaviour against rushdi onc the rushdi situat explod into the media the muslim voic on the matter of the book wa effect restrict to short video byte show the dramat highlight of muslim demonstr for everi twenti or so newspap magazin articl interview etc support rushdi there would appear on muslim voic thi person wa usual select base on how dramat and incoher he wa not on hi knowledg of islam or the situat at the time thi approx twenti to on ratio continu throughout the escal of the crisi with rushdi in the central spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defend of everyman s right to free speech decoupl from respons as an asid it s interest that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up some book defam certain ethnic and religi group continu to be ban here it wa felt that thei injur the sensibl of these group and present a fals imag which could promot feel of hate toward these group for muslim thi kind of doubl standard wa annoi rushdi saw thi spotlight as a golden opportun to lash out at organ islam and he did so with admir verbal skill the onli kind of islam which rushdi find palat is what he call a secular islam an islam separ from it s qur an it s prophet god it legisl and most importantli from ani intrus into ani polit arena fine rushdi made hi view known the muslim s made their anger at hi book known the scale of the whole affair erupt into global proport it wa by thi time alreadi a polit situat affect govern as well as individu the situat wa a seriou on with far reach polit implic at the centr of thi turmoil wa rushdi throw fuel on the fire engag in a person crusad that made him oblivi to ani sens of caution now you mai feel that the person in the centr of a worldwid storm such as thi ha no respons ha no reason to exercis restraint of ani kind ha no oblig to perhap step back momentarili out of the spotlight till matter calm down perhap you even feel that he is justifi in boldli defi the anger of all those who dare to take umbrag at hi literari work no matter what insult thei find within it perhap you see him as a kind of secular heroic knight mount on the hi media steed do battl with the dragon of islam fundament well khomeini saw him as a disingen author who grew up in a muslim atmospher knew well what muslim s hold dear who wrote a book which mischiev us certain literari convent to slander insult and attack islam and it most notabl person who when face with a situat that becam a worldwid crisi continu with hi mischief in the world stage of the media who even after peopl were injur and kill becaus of the magnitud and emot of the situat continu hi mischief instead of have the good sens to desist khomeini saw the crisi as mischief make on a grand scale mischief make that grew in scale as the scale of the crisi enlarg the death of muslim around the world and rushdi s continu media mischief even after thi wa the trigger factor that seem to decid khomeini on put a stop to the mischief the person at the centr of all these event wa rushdi he wa the sourc of the continu mischief all media support govern support wa just that support the sourc wa rushdi and hi publish who were noth short of ecstat at the public and were veri happi to see rushdi constantli in the media the islam rule that deal with peopl who engag in thi kind of grand scale mischief make wa appli to rushdi you re attempt at justif ar not do the imag of islam ani good i have made no attempt at justif onli at explan imag is the chief concern of muslim apologist for islam and for rushdi if muslim willingli releg themselv to becom a sub cultur within a larger secular cultur such that the secular principl and law had preced over the law of islam then i have no doubt that islam would then be thought to have a good imag princip becaus it would by and larg reflect the secular imag a good imag usual mean be more like me your attempt at total exoner rushdi reflect exactli the attitud that result in the polar brought about by the crisi in iran the situat wa monitor for mani month when rushdi kept ad fuel to the flame through the free worldwid voic that the media gave him the situat wa monitor more serious when even after mani death occur worldwid rushdi still did not desist the fatwa wa pronounc when behav like a total jerk endang live and the jerk see thi and still insist on hi right to behav like a total jerk he ha the rug jerk out from under him if the muslim didn t make such a big fuss over the book like issu death threat and kill publish no on would have heard of it the fatwa came later much later if rushdi didn t mouth off so much in the media the fuss would have di down no on would have been kill no fatwa would have been pass the whole episod would have fizzl awai
