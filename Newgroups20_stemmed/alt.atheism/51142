subject re polit atheist livesei solntz wpd sgi com jon livesei write much though it might be fun to debat capit punish itself thi is probabl the wrong group for it the onli relev here is that you don t seem to be abl to tell us what capit punish actual is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you ar us a term you have not yet defin well i ve said that when an innoc person ha been execut thi is object a murder howev who is at blame is anoth question it seem that the entir societi that sanction ani sort of execut realiz the risk is to blame there is a probabl of kill an innoc person by shoot at random into the air and there is a probabl of kill an innoc person when the state administ a system of capit punish so when you do either you know that thei action you ar take will sooner or later result in the kill of an innoc person ye but there is also a probabl that you will kill someon do ani raondom activ presum you had not isol yourself total from the rest of societi becaus of thi and drive will kill peopl as will airlin but peopl continu to do both drive and fly ar not punish inflict on unwil prison by court thei ar risk that we take upon ourselv willingli and i argu that our law system is a similar risk perhap an innoc person will be punish somedai but we work to prevent thi in fact mani crimin go free as a result of our try to prevent punish of innoc if our own drive kill someon els then sure there is a moral issu i know at least on person who wa involv in a fatal accid and thei felt vei guilti afterward but such accid ar to be total expect given the numner of vehic on the road again the blame is on societi no i m not thi is what you said you were sai that if there were such a fals wit that result in an innoc person be convict and kill it would still be the fault of the state sinc it did the actual kill no i just comment that the state doe the kill it doe not depend on there be fals wit how could it the state doe the kill even in the case of sincer mistak ye but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can onli do so much to prevent fals wit it is possibl so what ar you try to sai that capit punish is alwai murder becaus of the possibilti of human error invalid the system i m sai capit punish is murder period not becaus of thi that and the other but becaus it involv take human life that s my definit of murder i make no appeal to dictionari or to object moral okai so thi is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murder ar wrong ar you sai that all take of human life is wrong no matter what the circumst if we as a societi decid to murder someon then we should sai that and list our reason for do so and live with the moral consequ we should not plai word game and pretend that murder isn t murder and that s my opinion about how societi ought to be run but thi is basic how it work societi accept the risk that an innoc person will be murder by execut and everi member of societi share thi blame and most peopl s definit of murder includ some sort of malici intent which is not involv in an execut is it but we were try to discuss an object moral system or at least it possibilti what ramif doe your person system have on an object on no we were not discuss an object moral system i wa show you that you didn t have on becaus for on thing you were incap of defin the term in it for exampl murder murder violat the golden rule execut do not becaus by allow it at all societi implicitli accept the consequ no matter who the innoc victim is we re not talk about read mind we ar just talk about know the truth ye we can never be absolut certain that we have the truth but the court system work on a principl of know the truth beyond a reason doubt sorri but you simpli ar not quot yourself accur here is what you said and sinc we ar look total object at thi case then we know what peopl ar think when thei ar vote to execut the person or not if the intent is malici and unfair then the execut would be murder what you ar do now is to slide into anoth claim which is quit differ the juri be persuad beyond a seriou doubt is not the same as us know what is in their mind beyond a seriou doubt read the mind of the juri would certainli tell whether or not a convict wa moral or not but in an object system onli the absolut truth matter and the juri system is on method to approxim such a truth that is twelv member must be convinc of a truth moreov a juri which come from a suffici prejud background mai allow itself to be persuad beyond a seriou doubt on evid that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the mind of these peopl we would know that the convict wa unfair but would it be perfectli fair if we could read mind if we assum that it would be fair if we knew the absolut truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we onli have a good approxim of the absolut truth it s not a question of fair your claim which i have quot abov is a claim about whether we can know it wa fair so as to be abl to distinguish capit punishn from murder ye while we could object determin the differ if we knew all possibl inform we can t alwai determin the differ in our flaw system i think that our system is almost as good as possibl but it still isn t object perfect you see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not object it is either fair or it is not now there s a huge differ if we can read mind we can know and if we cannot read mind we can know noth the differ is not in degre of fair but in what we can know but what we know ha no effect on an object system i think it is possibl to produc a fairli object system if we ar clear on which goal it is suppos to promot i m not go to wast my time try to devis a system that i am pretti sure doe not exist why ar you so sure i simpli want peopl to confront realiti my realiti rememb why is your realiti import in thi case the realiti is that ideal theori apart we can never know even after the fact about the fair of the justic system for everi innoc person releas from death row there mai have been a dozen innoc peopl execut or a hundr or none at all we simpli don t know but we can assum that the system is fairli decent at least most like and you realiz that the correct of our system sai noth about a total ideal and object system now what ar we go to do on the on hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theori and that we can know thing we can never know and the justi system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain type of kill not murder and go on our wai well we can have an ideal system but the work system can not be ideal we can onli hope to creat a system that is as close an approxim to the ideal system as possibl on the other hand we can recogn that all justic ha a small we hope probabl of punish the innoc and that in the end we do bear moral respons even for the probabilist consequ of the system we set up and then sai well here we go murder again mayb some of us will even sai gee i wonder if all thi is strictli necessari ye we all bear the respons most peopl seem will to do thi i think that the second is prefer in that if requir peopl to face the moral consequ of what we do as a societi instead of shelter ourselv from them by magic ceremoni and word game we must realiz the consequ of all our action why do you keep separ the justic system from the pack and lest i forget i also don t think we have an object moral system and i believ i onli have to take that idea serious when someon present evid of it i don t think our countri ha an object system but i think such an object system can exist in theori without omnisci an object system is not possibl in practic keith
