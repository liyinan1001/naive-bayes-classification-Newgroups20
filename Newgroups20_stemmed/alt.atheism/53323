write which liber new media ar we talk about western new in gener but in particular the american mass media cb nbc abc etc the gener tone of the new dure the whole war wa on of those poor poor iraqi along with look how precis thi cruis missil blew thi build to bit most odd over here there wa veri littl about the suffer of the iraqi civilian until toward the end of the war and then it wa confin to the few remain qualiti newspap true at first the new media seem entranc by all the new gizmo the militari wa us not to mention the tape video transmiss from the missil as thei zero in on their target but later and especi after the bunker full of civilian wa hit thei chang their tone it seem to me that thei didn t have the stomach for the realiti of war that innoc peopl realli do die and ar maim in warfar it s like thei were onli pro gulf war as long as it wa nice and clean smart missil drop in on militari hq but not when pictur of dead dy and maim civilian start crop up what naiv hypocrit how about all the innoc peopl who di in blanket bomb in ww i don t hear you bemoan them discuss about blanket bomb and a bomb delet all thing consid the fire bomb and the atom bomb were essenti and therefor justifi in bring the war to a quick end to avoid even greater alli loss i should have said here militarili justifi it seem from your comment below that you understood thi as mean moral justifi i apolog what about the evid that america knew japan wa about to surrend after hiroshima but befor nagasaki is that anoth lie peddl by the liber media conspiraci i have often wonder about thi i ve alwai thought that the first bomb should have been drop on japan s island fortress of truk a good inpenatr militari target the second bomb could ve been held back for us on an industri center if need be but i digress ye i have heard that we found evid after the war btw that japan wa serious consid surrend after the first bomb unfortun the militari junta won out over the moder and reject the us s ulimatum therefor the second bomb wa drop most unfortun imo i for on don t regret it nuke a jap for jesu i don t regret the fact that sometim militari decis have to be made which affect the live of innoc peopl but i do regret the circumst which make those decis necessari and i regret the suffer caus by those decis why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still sell them stuff a coupl of week befor we start bomb i make no claim or effort to justifi the misguid foreign polici of the west befor the war it is evid that the west especi america misjudg hussein drastic but onc hussein invad kuwait and threaten to militarili corner a signific portion of the world s oil suppli he had to be stop oh i see so we can overlook hi us chemic weapon on thousand of peopl but if he threaten your right to drive a huge ga guzzl car well the man s gotta go actual it wa the fact that both situat exist that prompt us and alli action if some back water countri took over some other back water countri we probabl wouldn t interven not that we don t care but we can t be the world s policman or if a coup had occur in kuwait instead of an invas then we still wouldn t have act becaus there would not have been the immin danger perceiv to saudi arabia but the combin of the two an unprovok invas by a genocid tyrant and the potenti danger to the west s oil interest caus us to take action i ve move a paragraph from here to later on if we hadn t interven allow hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeas right but did you ever hear anyon advoc such a cours of action or ar you just set up a strawman i m not set up a strawman at all if you want to argu against the war then the onli logic altern wa to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomat altern includ sanction were ineffect i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innoc german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg ye do german ar human too you know sure what wa truli unfortun wa that thei follow hitler in hi grandios quest for a thousand year reich the consequ stem from that translat thei were ask for it well in a sens ye thei probabl had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to but what about those who didn t support hitler s dream of conquest it s not as if thei democrat vote for all hi polici the nsdap got in the elect of and that wa the last chanc the german peopl got to vote on the matter thei suffer along with the rest why doe thi bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumst ar not perfect mani innoc suffer due to the wrong action of other it it regret but that s the wai it is there ar no perfect solut i look forward to hear your incis comment about east timor and tibet what should i sai about them anyth in particular the peopl of east timor ar still be kill by a dictatorship that invad their countri hell even western journalist have been kill all thi wa happen befor the gulf war why didn t we send in the bomber to east timor why aren t we send in the bomber now probabl becaus we re not the savior of the world we can t polic each and everi countri that decid to self destruct or invad anoth nor ar we in a strateg posit to get relief to tibet east timor or some other place here s that paragraph i move what s your intent to sound like a love christian well you aren t do a veri good job of it well it s not veri love to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobbl up nearbi countri and keep them or to allow them to continu with mass slaughter of certain peopl under their dominion so i d have to sai ye stop hussein wa the most love thing to do for the most peopl involv onc he set hi mind on militari conquest the chines govern ha a polici of mandatori abort and steril of tibetan tibetan peopl ar round up tortur and execut amnesti intern recent report that tortur is still widespread in china why aren t we stop them in fact why ar we activ suck up to them by trade freeli with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for on do not agre with the present us polici of suck up to them as you put it i agre that it is deplor and as for poor poor rodnei king did you ever stop and think why the juri in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilti ye amongst the thing i thought were hmm there s an aw lot of white peopl in that juri so it wa the policemen on trial not rodnei king erm sure it s irrelev who s on trial juri ar suppos to repres a cross section of the popul ar thei or ar thei suppos to reflect the popul of the local where the trial is held normal thi is where the crime is commit unless on parti or the other can convinc the judg a chang of venu is in order i m not an expert on california law or even us law but it seem that thi is the wai the system is set up you can critic the system but let s not have unfound alleg of racial prejudic thrown around and under american law thei deserv a juri of their peer you ar sai that black peopl ar not the peer of white peopl no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no black on the first juri and that rodnei king is black is total irrelev thi point of allegedli racial motiv is realli shallow thi idea of peopl onli be tri befor a juri of peopl just like them is realli stupid should the nuremburg trial have had a juri entir made up of nazi german perhap peer doesn t mean those who do the same thing like have murder judg murder it mean have peopl from the same station in life presum becaus thei ar in a better posit to understand the defend s motiv s those who have been foam at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainli have look no further than the video tape but the juri look at all the evid evid which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beat someon who s ly defenceless on the ground it s rather hard to imagin what thi other evid might have been so it s hard to imagin so when ha argument from incredul gain accept from the rever author of construct a logic argument we re not talk about a logic argument we re talk about a court of law as the faq point out some fallaci argument ar not view as fallaci in a court of law ok grant howev you ar us thi reason as part of your logic argument in thi discuss thi is not a court of law if the fact as the new comment present them ar true then i feel the not guilti verdict wa a reason on were you not talk earlier about the bia of the liber media conspiraci the media is not total monolith even though there is a prevail liber bia program such as the macneil lehrer new hour try to give a balanc and fair report of the new there ar even conserv sourc out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never us the word conspiraci i don t accept without far more evid theori that there is some all pervad liber conspiraci attempt to take over all new sourc thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretti good reason for kill in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyon who get in the wai as unfortun it cannot be help jim brown bibl for love christian thank mathew i like the quot pretti funni actual i m a monti python fan you know kind of seem in that vein of cours oversimplifi ani moral argument can make it seem contradictori but then you know that alreadi ha ha onli seriou i an atheist am argu against kill innoc peopl you a suppos christian ar argu that it s ok to kill innoc peopl so long as you get some guilti on as well hardli i didn t sai that it s a good thing tm to kill innoc peopl if the end is just unfortun we don t live in a perfect world and there ar no perfect solut if on is go to resist tyranni then innoc peopl on both side ar go to suffer and die i didn t sai it is ok it is unfortun but sometim necessari i a moral relativist am argu that satur bomb of german citi at the end of world war ii wa as far as i can see an evil and unnecessari act i would agre that it wa evil in the sens that it caus much pain and suffer i m not so sure that it wa unnecessari as you sai that conclus can onli be arriv at by evalu all the factor involv and perhap it wa unnecessari as let s sai we now know that doesn t mean that those who had to make the decis to bomb didn t see it as be necessari rare can on have full known of the consequ of an action befor make a decis at the time it mai have seem necessari enough to go ahead with it but don t assum that i feel the bomb wa moral justifi i don t i just don t condemn those who had to make a difficult decis under difficult circumst you have criticis moral relativ in the past ar now argu that i am in no posit to judg the moral of alli action at the end of the war you certainli ar not in such a posit if you ar a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a posit to judg but i defer judgment you ar argu that the action need to be assess in the particular context of the time and that thei might have been moral then but not moral now wrong thei were neither moral then nor now thei seem necessari to those make the decis to bring a quick end to the war i simpli refus to condemn them for their decis where s your christian love where s your absolut moral oh how quick you ar to discard them when it suit you as ivan stang would sai jesu would puke on dai i will stand befor jesu and give account of everi word and action even thi discours in thi forum i understand the full ramif of that and i am prepar to do so i don t believ that you can make the same claim mathew and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bomb in germani wa becaus you were bemoan the iraqi civilian casualti as be so deplor yet blanket bomb wa institut becaus bomb wasn t accur enough to hit industri militari target in a decis wai by ani other method at that time but in the gulf war precis bomb wa the norm so the point wa why make a big stink about the rel few civilian casualti that result in spite of precis bomb when so mani more civilian proportion and quantit di under the blanket bomb in ww even with precis bomb mistak happen and some civilian suffer but less civilian suffer in thi war than ani other iani other in histori mani iraqi civilian went about their live with minim interfer from the alli air raid the stori of hundr of thousand of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk ye bunk the us lost servicemen in ww over four year and the major of them were directli involv in fight but we ar expect to swallow that hundr of thousand of civilian iraqi di in a war last about month and with the alli us the most precis bomb ever creat at that what hogwash if hundr of thousand of iraqi civilian di it wa due to action hussein took on hi own peopl not due to the alli bomb regard jim b
