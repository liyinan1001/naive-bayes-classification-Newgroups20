subject re concern god s moral wa american and evolut in articl apr batman bmd trw com jbrown batman bmd trw com write why do babi get diseas etc what god did creat wa life accord to a protein code which is mutabl and can evolv without delv into a deep discuss of creation vs evolution here s the main problem the scenario you outlin is reason consist but all the evid that i am familiar with not onli doe not support it but indic someth far differ the earth by latest estim is about billion year old and ha had life for about billion of those year human have onli been around for at most about year but the fossil evid inidc that life ha been chang and evolv and in fact diseas ridden long befor there were peopl ye there ar fossil that show sign of diseas mostli bone disord of cours but there ar some heck not just fossil evid but what we ve been abl to glean from genet studi show that diseas ha been around for a long long time if human sin wa what brought about diseas at least indirectli though necessarili then how could it exist befor human god creat the origin genet code perfect and without flaw and without get sidetrack into the theolog ramif of the origin sin the main effect of the so call origin sin for thi discuss wa to remov human from god s protect sinc by their choic a e cut themselv off from intim fellowship with god in addit their sin caus them to come under the dominion of satan who then assum dominion over the earth delet sinc human wa no longer under god s protect but under satan s dominion it wa no great feat for satan to genet engin diseas both bacteri viral and genet although the forc of natur select tend to improv the surviv of speci the degener of the genet code tend to more than offset thi uh i know of mani evolutionari biologist who know more about biologi than you claim to who will strongli disagre with thi there is no evid that the human genet code or ani other start off in perfect condit it seem to adapt to it envion in a collect sens i m realli curiou as to what you mean by the degener of the genet code human dna be more complex tend to accumul error advers affect our well be and abil to fight off diseas while the simpler dna of bacteria and virus tend to becom more effici in caus infect and diseas it is a bad combin umm nah we seem to do a pretti good job of adapt to virus and bacteria and thei to us onli a veri small percentag of microlif is harm to human and that small percentag seem to be reasonalbi constant in size but the rank keep chang for exampl bubon plagu us to be a realli nasti diseas i m sure you ll agre but it still pop up from time to time even todai and doesn t do as much damag part of that is becaus of better sanit but even when peopl get the diseas the symptom tend to be less sever than in the past thi seem to be partli becaus peopl who were veri suscept di off long ago and becaus the realli nasti variant overgraz forgiv the poor terminolog i m an engin not a doctor and di off for lack of nearbi host i could be wrong on thi but from what i gather acn is onli a few hundr year old and us to be nastier though no killer it seem to be get less nasti w ag henc we have newborn that suffer from genet viral and bacteri diseas disord now wait a minut i have a question human were creat perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abilii to fight off diseas it seem unlik that satan who s make the diseas would also gift human with the mean to fight them off simpler to make the diseas less lethal if he want survivor as far as i can see our immun system imperfect though thei mai present be must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on thi ar you sai that god wa plan ahead for the time when satan would be in charg by build an immun system that wa not at the time of design necessari that is god made our immun system ahead of time know that adam and ev would sin and their descend would need to fight off diseas thi mai be more of a mystic supernatur explan than you ar prepar to accept but god is not respons for diseas even if satan had noth to do with the origin incept of diseas evolut by random chanc would have produc them sinc human forsook god s protect here s anoth puzzl what exactli do you mean by perfect in the phrase creat perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incap of degrad over time a perfect system that will without constant intervent becom imperfect is not a perfect system at least imho or is it that god did someth like write a masterpiec novel on a bunch of gum wrapper held togeth with elmer s glue that is the origin genet instruct were perfect but were written in inferior materi that had to be carefulli tend or would fall apart if so why could god not have us better materi wa god incap of creat a system that could maintain itself of did it just choos not to delet in summari newborn ar innoc but god doe not caus their suffer my main point as i said wa that there realli isn t ani evid for the explan you give at least that i m awar of but i couldn t help make a few nitpick here and there sincer rai ingl the abov opinion ar probabl not those of the univers of ingl engin umich edu michigan yet
