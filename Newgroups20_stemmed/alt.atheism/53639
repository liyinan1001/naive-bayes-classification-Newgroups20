subject re after year can we sai that christian moral is in r n hfj horu ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp write deletia in case anybodi hadn t notic frank and i ar debat object moral and seemingli hit semant secondli how can i refut your definit i can onli point up it logic implic and sai that thei seem to contradict the usag of the word object in other area inde by your definit an object x is an oxymoron for all x i have no quibbl with that belief other than that it is useless and that object is a perfectli good word it mai be that be a non nativ english speaker i ve misunderstood your usag of object and tri to debat someth you don t assert my apolog i m at a loss to imagin what you realli do mean though how mani ag can the univers have and still be intern self consist i d be amaz if it wa more than on how mani differ moral system can differ member of societi have inde singl individu in some case and human still stick togeth beg the question peopl can have mani opinion about the ag of the univers and human can still stick togeth you ar sai that the univers ha a real ag independ of my belief about it why wrong point the ag of the univers ha no direct effect on human s stick power in the wai the moral system of a societi can have i m sai the univers ha a real ag becaus i see evid for it cosmolog astronomi and so on i sai thi ag is independ of peopl s opinion of it becaus i know differ peopl have a lot of differ opinion in the matter yet empir test consist seem to give roughli the same result the ag of the univers like most scientif fact can be emir verifi through mean that ll give the same result no matter who perform the test albeit there ar error bar that mai be on the largish side thi assum that the univers ha a real ag or ani kind of realiti which doesn t depend on what we think i can t see how it doe that put a creationist to the task of perform the test and calcul see to it s he make no blatant error in measur or calcul and the result of the test will be the same why should an extrem biblic creationist give a rat s ass about the mean of which you speak becaus logic consist empir test contradict their opinion if those test were just my opinion then their own test which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conduct said test in ident manner no thei don t which i take as show these test have some valid beyond our opinion of them i ve heard of no wai to verifi moral in a consist wai much less comput the error of the measur care to enlighten me the same is true of pain but painkil exist and can be predict to work with some accuraci better than a random guess map the activ of nerv and neural activ if you mean physic pain you have a sharp point i ll give you that but you still haven t given me a wai to quantifi moral i wrote elsewher that moral should be hypothes about observ valu we agre hypothes howev can chang i hold that there is no ultim hypothesi of moral toward which these chang could gravit but that thei could be chang in ani wai imagin produc differ result suitabl for differ task or purpos if a moral system make a predict it will be better if that can be test better and wors ar almost alwai defin in the context of a moral system your predict will alwai be correct within that moral system what you need now is an object definit of good and bad i wish you luck peopl s idea about the ag of object x ar not object you can have ani idea you like and i can t stop you universa and their ag is anoth ballgam thei ar what thei ar and if you dislik some detail of them that s a problem with your opinion of them sure assum an object realiti and you get statement like thi isn t that what you re do when assum an object real moral besid what exactli is provabl wrong with my statement i claim that moral is an opinion of our and as such subject and individu if i m wrong then some more or less object real thing exist which you label object moral can you back up thi posit claim of exist can you back up your posit claim abov no that s becaus it s an assumpt i make the same assumpt about valu on the basi that there is no logic differ between the two and the empir basi of the two is precis the same claim there is no object moral is suddenli a posit claim besid i think i can lend some credenc to my claim ponder differ individu both fulli function as human be and member of societi but yet with wildli differ moral code if moral wa object at least on should be wai off base but yet hir incorrect moral seem to function fine how come as for produc these individu it might be easiest to pick them from differ societi sai an islam on and some polynesian matrilin system for exampl if such still exist deletia test for footbal on desk now take a look at moral see anyth if so pleas inform me which wai to look and why to look that particular wai as oppos to some other get my drift no just look ar you claim never to know what good mean on thing is good under some circumst becaus we wish to achiev some goal for some reason other time we wish to do someth els and that thing is no longer so clearli good at all some thing ar hard to make good becaus we d seldom if ever wish to achiev the sort of goal mass murder would lead on into still the aztec were do fine until the spaniard wipe them out i almost alwai know what good mean sometim i even know why i never claim thi good is therebi fix in stone immut that s a simpl matter of prove the track record of the scientif method i think it s great and should be appli to valu i mai be complet wrong but that s what i conclud as a result of quit an amount of thought ye me too and i ve tri a thing or two down that line it doesn t look good for object valu to me at all disclaim it s great to be young and insan
