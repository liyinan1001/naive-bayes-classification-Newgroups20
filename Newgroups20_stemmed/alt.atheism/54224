subject re free moral agenc andrew newel tan psuvm psu edu wrote i think you re let atheist mytholog confus you on the issu of webster myth a tradit or legendari stori a belief whose truth is accept uncrit how doe that qualifi inde it s almost oxymoron a rather amus instanc i ve found that most atheist hold almost no atheist view as accept uncrit especi the few that ar legend mani ar try to explain basic truth as myth do but thei don t meet the other criterion andrew the myth to which i refer is the convolut counterfeit athiest have creat to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion includ christain in a ration manner and debat it claim as the ar state atheist concoct outrag parodi and then hold the religi account for belief thei don t have what is more accur oxymor is the a term like reason atheist bill divin justic accord to the most fundament doctrin of christian when the first man sin he wa at that time the you accus him of referenc mytholog then you proced to launch your own xtian mytholog thi time meet all the requir of myth here s a good exampl of of what i said abov read the post again i said acoord to which mean i am refer to christian doctrin as i understand it if i am speak for myself you ll know it my purpos in post wa to present a basic overview of christain doctrin sinc it seem german bill with those who pretend not to know what is be said and what it mean when atheist claim that thei do not know if god exist and don t know what he want thei contradict the bibl which clearli sai that everyon know the author of the bibl is it claim to be should i repeat what i wrote abov for the sake of get it across you mai trust the bibl but your trust it doesn t make it ani more credibl to me if the bibl sai that everyon know that s clearli reason to doubt the bibl becaus not everyon know your alleg god s alleg exist again i am paraphras christian doctrin which is veri clear on thi point your disput is not with me bill refut while the speci wide condemn is justifi those that claim that there is no evid for the exist of god or that hi will is unknown must deliber ignor the bibl the ignor itself is no excus no thei don t have to ignor the bibl the bibl is far from univers accept the bibl is not a proof of god it is onli a proof that some peopl have thought that there wa a god or doe it prove even that thei might have been write it as seri of fiction short stori as in the case of dionet assum the writer believ it the onli thing it could possibl prove is that thei believ it and that s ignor the problem of whether or not all the interpret and biblic philosoph were correct there ar peopl who have truli never heard of the bibl again read the faq here again you miss the point the bibl itself is not the point it s what it contain it make no differ who accpet the bibl or even who s unawar of it exist christian hold that it appli univers becaus mankind share the same natur and the same fate and the same innat knowledg of god see abov if you read my post with same care as read the faq we wouldn t be have thi convers bill freedom you ar free to ignor god in the same wai you ar free to ignor graviti and the consequ ar inevit and well known in both case that an atheist can t accept the evid mean onli bzzt wrong answer graviti is directli there it doesn t stop exert a direct and ration undeni influenc if you ignor it god on the other hand doesn t gener show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid god doesn t exert a ration undeni influenc graviti is obviou god aren t as i said the evid is there you just don t accept it here at least we agre bill secondli human reason is veri comforatbl with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrins to our natur human reason alwai come back to the question of god in everi gener and in no human reason hasn t alwai come back to the exist of god it ha usual come back to the exist of god in other word it doesn t gener come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there is ani god and in much of orient philosoph histori it gener doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natur forc ar and which on ar out there from a world wide view human natur just make us wonder how the univers came to be and or what forc s ar current in control a natur tendanc to believ in god onli exist in religi wish think ye human reason doe alwai come back to the exist of god we re have thi discuss ar we not bill i said all thi to make the point that christian is emin reason that divin justic is just and human natur is much differ than what atheist think it is whether you agre or not you certainli ar not correct on human natur you ar at the least base your view on a complet eurocentr approach try look at the outsid world as well when you attempt to sum up all of human well thi is interest truth is to be determin by it polit correct content grant it s extrem unhip to be a wasp male and anyth european is contempt but i thought thi kind of dialogu the purpos of a a wa to get at the truth of thing but then i rememb the oxymoron reasonalbl atheist and i understand bill
