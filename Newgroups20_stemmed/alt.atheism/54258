in the account of the trial crucifict and resurect of jesu if these ar good wit you would think that thei could get some of these import detail right in fact i cannot find veri mani point on where thei agre you would think that thei could at least agre on some of the point thei were supposedli observ becaus of the fact that there is so much contradict and error the stori of the resurect as present cannot be taken as liter truth due to the natur of the stori i doubt if it should be taken as ani sort of truth alan
