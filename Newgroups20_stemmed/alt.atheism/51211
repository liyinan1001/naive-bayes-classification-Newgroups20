subject re concern god s moral long thi kind of argument cri for a comment jbrown batman bmd trw com wrote in articl apr leland stanford edu galahad leland stanford edu scott compton write jim you origin wrote god did not creat diseas nor is he respons for the maladi of newborn what god did creat wa life accord to a protein code which is mutabl and can evolv without delv into a deep discuss of creation vs evolution god creat the origin genet code perfect and without flaw do you have ani evid for thi if the code wa onc perfect and ha degrad ever sinc we should have some evid in favour of thi statement shouldn t we perhap the biggest imperfect of the code is that it is full of non code region intron which ar so call becaus thei interven with the code region exon an impress amount of evid suggest that intron ar of veri ancient origin it is like that earli exon repres earli protein domain is the number of intron decreas or increas it appear that intron loss can occur and speci with common ancestri usual have quit similar exon intron structur in their gene on the other hand the possibl that intron have been insert later present sever logic difficulti intron ar remov by a splice mechan thi would have to be present but unus if intron ar insert moreov intron insert would have requir precis target random insert would not be toler sinc sequenc for intron remov self splice of mrna ar conserv besid transposit of a sequenc usual leav a trace long termin repeat and target site duplic and these ar not found in or near intron sequenc i serious recommend read textbook on molecular biologi and genet befor post theolog argument like thi try watson s molecular biologi of the gene or darnel lodish baltimor s molecular biologi of the cell for starter rememb the question wa pose in a theolog context why doe god caus diseas in newborn and my answer is likewis from a theolog perspect my own it is no less valid than a pure scientif perspect just differ scientif perspect is support by the evid wherea theolog perspect often fail to fulfil thi criterion i think you misread my mean i said god made the genet code perfect but that doesn t mean it s perfect now it ha certainli evolv sinc for the wors would you pleas cite a few refer that support your assert your assert is less valid than the scientif perspect unless you support it by some evid in fact it ha been claim that parasit and diseas ar perhap more import than we ve thought for instanc sex might have evolv as defenc against parasit thi view is support by comput simul of evolut eg tierra perhap i thought it wa higher energi rai like x rai gamma rai and cosmic rai that caus most of the damag in fact it is thermal energi that doe most of the damag although it is usual mild and easili fix by enzymat action actual neither of us know what the atmospher wa like at the time when god creat life accord to my recollect most biologist do not claim that life began billion year ago after all that would onli be a half billion year or so after the earth wa creat it would still be too primit to support life i seem to rememb a figur more like to billion year ago for the origin of life on earth anyon with a better estim i d replac creat with form sinc there is no need to invok ani creator if the earth can be form without on most recent estim of the ag of the earth rang between billion year and earliest sign of life not true fossil but organ stromatolit like layer date back to billion year thi would leav more than billion year for the first cell to evolv i m sorri i can t give ani refer thi is base on the cours on evolutionari biochemistri i attend here dominion it wa no great feat for satan to genet engin diseas both bacteri viral and genet although the forc of natur select tend to improv the surviv of speci the degener of the genet code tend to more than offset thi again do you want thi be true or do you have ani evid for thi suppos degener i can understand scott s reaction excus me but thi is so far fetch that i know you must be jest do you know what pathogen ar do you know what point mutat ar do you know that everyth can come about spontan in respons to your last statement no and neither do you you mai veri well believ that and accept it as fact but you cannot know that i hope you don t forget thi we have evid that suggest everyth can come about spontan do you have evid against thi conclus in scienc on doe not have to believ in anyth it is a healthi sign to doubt and disbeliev but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evid if you do so and not to present on s own conclus prior to thi theologi doe not us thi method therefor i serious doubt it could ever come to right conclus human dna be more complex tend to accumul error advers affect our well be and abil to fight off diseas while the simpler dna of bacteria and virus tend to becom more effici in caus infect and diseas it is a bad combin henc we have newborn that suffer from genet viral and bacteri diseas disord you ar suppos a purpos not a valid move bacteria and virus do not exist to caus diseas thei ar just anoth manifest of a gener principl of evolut onli replic save replic from degradi we ar just an effici method for our dna to surviv and replic the less effici method didn t make it to the present and for the last time pleas present some evid for your claim that human dna is degrad through evolutionari process some peopl have claim that the opposit is true we have suppress our select and thu ar bound to degrad i haven t seen much evid for either claim but then i ask so where is thi relev to my discuss in answer john s question of why why ar there genet diseas and why ar there so mani bacteri and viral diseas which requir babi to develop antibodi is it god s fault the origin question i sai no it is not of cours noth evil is god s fault but your explan doe not work it fail miser you mai be right but the fact is that you don t know that satan is not respons and neither do i suppos that a power evil be like satan exist would it be inconceiv that he might be respons for mani of the ill that affect mankind i don t think so he could have done a much better job pun intend the problem is it seem no satan is necessari to explain ani diseas thei ar just as inevit as ani product of evolut did i sai that where seem to me like anoth bad infer actual what you ve done is to oversimplifi what i said to the point that your summari of my word take on a new context i never said that peopl ar meant presum by god to be punish by get diseas why i did sai is that free moral choic have attend consequ if mankind choos to reject god as peopl have done sinc the begin then thei should not expect god to protect them from advers event in an entrop univers i am not expect thi if god exist i expect him to leav us alon i would also like to hear why do you believ your choic ar inde free thi is an interest philosoph question and the answer is not as clear cut as it seem to be what consequ would you expect from reject allah oh i admit it s not perfect yet but i m work on it a good librari or a bookstor is a good start point what doe thi have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provid an answer biologi and genet ar fine subject and import scientif endeavor but thei explain how god creat and set up life process thei don t explain the why behind creation life or it subsequ evolut why is there a why behind and your proposit wa someth that is not support by the evid thi is why we recommend these book is there ani need to invok ani why behind a prime mover evid for thi if the whole univers can come into exist without ani intervent as recent cosmolog theori hawk et al suggest why do peopl still insist on thi thank scotti for your fine and sage advic but i am not highli motiv to learn all the nitti gritti detail of biologi and genet although i m sure i d find it a fascin subject for i realiz that the detail do not chang the big pictur that god creat life in the begin with the abil to chang and adapt to it environ i m sorri but thei do there is no evid for your big pictur and no need to creat anyth that is capabl of adapt it
