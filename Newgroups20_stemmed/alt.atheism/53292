ye fortun we have right think folk like your good self in power and it wa therefor deem accept to slaughter ten or even hundr o thousand of iraqi in order to liber oil h h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi death were wai over exagger and exploit for anti war emotion by the liber new media the fact ar that less iraqi di in the gulf war than did civilian in ani other war of compar size thi centuri let s analyz thi claim a littl how is the size of a war defin by number of particip geograph area number of countri involv number of casualti size of armi durat number of casualti both absolut and as a percentag of those involv geograph area and number of countri too ar all measur of size in thi case i d sai the relev statist would be the number of combat total troop compar to total casualti from among the total civilian popul in the affect geograph area which other compar war ar we talk about vietnam and korea might make good comparison which liber new media ar we talk about western new in gener but in particular the american mass media cb nbc abc etc the gener tone of the new dure the whole war wa on of those poor poor iraqi along with look how precis thi cruis missil blew thi build to bit thi wa due mostli to the short durat coupl with precis surgic bomb techniqu which were technic possibl onli recent i suspect that medic advanc mai have someth to do with it too i agre how about all the innoc peopl who di in blanket bomb in ww i don t hear you bemoan them perhap becaus the topic hasn t crop up if you want my opinion i think that the blanket bomb of german citi at the end of world war two wa the most appal act of wholesal slaughter thi countri ha commit in centuri bomber harri wa no hero of mine perhap so and mayb the atom bomb wa a mistak too but that s easi to sai from our enlighten viewpoint here in the s right back then it wa all out war and germani and japan had to be squash after all a million or more british had alreadi di hundr of thousand of french a coupl hundread thousand or so american and million of russian not to mention a few million jew pole and other peopl of slavic descent in german concentr camp all thing consid the fire bomb and the atom bomb were essenti and therefor justifi in bring the war to a quick end to avoid even greater alli loss i for on don t regret it war is never an exact scienc but with smart bomb it s becom more exact with a smaller percentag of civilian casualti sometim mistak ar made target ar misidentifi innoc die that s war the wai it realli is entrench polit ruler oper in their own selfish interest without regard for the live of other peopl that is the wai war realli is sure and it s the peopl who suffer becaus of them all the more reason to depos these entrench polit ruler oper in their own selfish interest or do you mean that thi appli to the alli as well why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still sell them stuff a coupl of week befor we start bomb i make no claim or effort to justifi the misguid foreign polici of the west befor the war it is evid that the west especi america misjudg hussein drastic but onc hussein invad kuwait and threaten to militarili corner a signific portion of the world s oil suppli he had to be stop sure the war could have been prevent by judici and concert effort on the part of the west befor hussein invad kuwait but it is still hussein who is respons for hi decis to invad and onc he did so a strong respons from the west wa requir mathew your sarcasm is note but you ar complet off base here you come off sound like a complet peac nik idiot although i feel sure that wa not your intent what s your intent to sound like a love christian well you aren t do a veri good job of it well it s not veri love to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobbl up nearbi countri and keep them or to allow them to continu with mass slaughter of certain peopl under their dominion so i d have to sai ye stop hussein wa the most love thing to do for the most peopl involv onc he set hi mind on militari conquest so the iraqi war wa wrong eh i m sure that appeas would have work better than war just like it did in ww eh who even mention appeas and what make you think the situat is even remot analog to world war two i mention it if we hadn t interven allow hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeas it is precis the lesson the world learn in ww that motiv the western allianc to war let hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww from happen and let hussein keep kuwait would not have stop an eventu gulf war to protect saudi arabia i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innoc german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg ye do german ar human too you know sure what wa truli unfortun wa that thei follow hitler in hi grandios quest for a thousand year reich the consequ stem from that tyrant like hussein have to be stop hi kind don t understand diplomaci thei onli understand the point of a gun my onli regret is that bush wimp out and didn t have the militari roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peopl s sacrific not to mention the american who di wa for naught i look forward to hear your incis comment about east timor and tibet what should i sai about them anyth in particular and as for poor poor rodnei king did you ever stop and think why the juri in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilti ye amongst the thing i thought were hmm there s an aw lot of white peopl in that juri so it wa the policemen on trial not rodnei king and under american law thei deserv a juri of their peer if there had been black offic involv i m sure their would have been black juror too thi point of allegedli racial motiv is realli shallow those who have been foam at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainli have look no further than the video tape but the juri look at all the evid evid which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beat someon who s ly defenceless on the ground it s rather hard to imagin what thi other evid might have been so it s hard to imagin so when ha argument from incredul gain accept from the rever author of construct a logic argument can we expect anoth revis soon just kid if there is some wonder evid why is it seemingli be kept secret why not tell everyon what it is then everyon could sai oh ye you re right king deserv a good beat and we could all live happili ever after i have to admit that i wonder thi too but neither the prosecut nor the defens is talk so on cannot conclud either wai due to the silenc of the princip law in thi countri is intend to protect the right of the accus whether thei be crimin or cop on is not found guilti if there is a reason doubt of on s guilt and onli the juri is in a posit to assess the evid and render a verdict fine but i m still find it hard to imagin what the reason doubt wa in thi case i mean the cop certainli seem to be beat someon who s ly defenceless on the ground what s your explan mass hallucin orbit mind control laser fake video footag do tell ok it certainli seem to me that there wa excess forc involv and frankli the origin not guilti verdict baffl me too but then i learn that the prosecut in the first case did not try to convict on a charg of excess forc or simpl assault which thei probabl would have won thei tri to get a convict on a charg of aggrav assault with intent to inflict seriou bodili harm a charg which new comment said wa akin to attempt murder under california law base on what the prosecut wa ask for it s evid that the first juri decid that the offic were not guilti note not not guilti of do wrong but not guilti of aggrav assault with the intent of inflict seriou bodili harm the seed of the prosecut defeat were in their own overconfid in obtain a verdict such that thei went for the most extrem charg thei could if the fact as the new comment present them ar true then i feel the not guilti verdict wa a reason on mathew thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretti good reason for kill in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyon who get in the wai as unfortun it cannot be help jim brown bibl for love christian thank mathew i like the quot pretti funni actual i m a monti python fan you know kind of seem in that vein of cours oversimplifi ani moral argument can make it seem contradictori but then you know that alreadi regard jim b love christian
