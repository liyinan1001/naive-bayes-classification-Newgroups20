subject re some thought bissda saturn wwc edu dan lawrenc bissel write first i want to start right out and sai that i m a christian it make sens to be on have ani of you read toni campollo s book liar lunat or the real thing i might be a littl off on the titl but he write the book anywai he wa part of an effort to destroi christian in the process he becam a christian himself i assum you ar post to encourag comment how much histori ha toni campello read not much it seem the arguement he us i am sum up the book is about whether jesu wa god or not i know mani of you don t believ but listen to a differ perspect for we all have someth to gain by listen to what other have to sai it is good to hear that there ar a few reason christian about if onli those christian scientist would take note in australia there is a veri strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believ that everi singl event in the bibl is exactli true and that there is a ration explan for it all that can be justifi by us the law of physic for exampl there ar a few chap who ar try to prove that the ag of the univers is year old and that the error in convent calcul is the result of the fact that the speed light ha been rapidli decai over the year and thi ha not been account for the book sai that jesu wa either a liar or he wa crazi a modern dai koresh or he wa actual who he said he wa or of cours that he never exist and the bibl wa a stori and wa never intend to becom a manifesto for a billion peopl did toni follow that on up some reason why he wouldn t be a liar ar as follow who would die for a lie wouldn t peopl be abl to tell if he wa a liar peopl gather around him and kept do it mani gather from hear or see someon who wa or had been heal million of peopl have di for a lie thi point is difficult to substanti sinc it is not well defin a great mani religi argument work in that wai but consid the mani aztec warrior who sacrif themselv to their god in the belief that thi act would bring them victori of the spanish invad the list is endless the aztec lost btw call me a fool but i believ he did heal peopl that is perfectli reason but it is not ground for me or anyon to becom a christian more to the point it doe not add weight to the claim that jesu wa the real thing niether wa he a lunat would more than an entir nation be drawn to someon who wa crazi veri doubt in fact redicul for exampl anyon who is drawn to david koresh is obvious a fool logic peopl see thi right awai have you ever seen a documentari about the rise of nazi germani more to the point did toni mention thi on could hardli call werner heisenberg and hi mani colleagu fool or illog men their support of hitler wa base i presum upon an emot issu rather than a ration agreement with hi principl obvious my argument is invalid if toni thought that hitler wa sane therefor sinc he wasn t a liar or a lunat he must have been the real thing hmmm i don t think hi argument warrant the us of a therefor some other thing to note he fulfil load of propheci in the psalm isaiah and elsewher in hr alon thi in hi betray and crucifixion i don t have my bibl with me at thi moment next time i write i will us it thi is unfortun what alot of religi discuss i have had with peopl result in quot the bibl the onli reason wai i think peopl can look at the bibl is to treat the stori as some sort of metaphor represent of the messag that the author were try to present if someon tri to interpret part of the bibl liter he or she will end up in all sort of shit toni s argument would be perfectli reason for peopl who believ the event describ in the bibl took place but to convinc someon who think the bibl is total fiction that jesu is real by quot the book is total pointless for exampl in mathemat you cannot sai a is equal to b becaus a is equal to b i don t think most peopl understand what a christian is that would possibl explain why there have so mani peopl be kill in religi war and why there ar hundr of differ version all claim to be correct it is certainli not what i see a lot in church rather i think it should be a wai of life and a total sacrafic of everyth for god s sake he love us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hei we can t do it god himself inspir us to turn our live over to him that s tuff and most peopl don t want to do it to be a real christian would be someth for the strong to persever at but just like weight lift or guitar plai drum whatev it take time we don t rush it in on dai christian is your whole life it is not go to church onc a week or help poor peopl onc in a while we box everyth into time unit such as work at thi time sport tv social life god is abov these box and should be carri with us into all these box that we have creat for ourselv i think if you post thi part to alt religion you would get more flame than here i have never realli understood why the emot sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other peopl someon famou said that there two evil in life polititian and church on rule by fear of the live the other by fear of the dead if i am press i could probabl find the exact quotat cheer charl
