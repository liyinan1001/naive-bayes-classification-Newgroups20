subject re lc ram upgrad will be slow douc tfsquad mn org andrew gewek write i cannot speak for dale but i am quit sure that the macintosh us the full bit or bit data path to it full advantag that is it is run as fast with two or four pin simm as it would with on pin simm now it mai be that longword access assum a bit data path here get the first byte from the first simm the second byte from the second and so on thi would mean that each longword of memori is actual split among four simm on for each byte on the other hand it could be that the simm ar interleav by word or longword not just by byte or thei could be success in memori and the memori control deal with the eight bit data path that each on ha i suspect though that thei ar interleav to some extent so that bit can be read or written at onc thi would indic a byte level interleav i am not confus thi with the new machin longword interleav with two pin simm of the same sort although that seem to be the same sort of idea there you get an essenti bit data path ro excus me to ram instead of just a bit on ye the cpu can t handl it but when write to success address it speed someth up so dale am i right pin simm ar interleav by byte allow the full data bu or as is common with usenet and me in particular am i as clueless as everyon els what conclus can be drawn from thi i m try to figur out what kind of memori configur for the lc iii bit datapath would be fastest ani idea thank jason macdonald jason scott macdonald jsm cornel edu jsm crux cit cornel edu technolog suffici advanc is indistinguish from magic cat exist so that we arthur c clark mai caress the lion
