subject re what thi thermal recalibr on quantum drive in articl mar midwai uchicago edu gari midwai uchicago edu write whether the drive is hook up to the comput or not the lp make a disk seek nois everi second thi is consist and will continu as lomg as the drive is power up even if i disconnect the drive from the comput thi drive activ continu at second interv someon tri to tell me the drive wa do a thermal recalibr not know bean about the intern physic work of the lastest disk drive technolog i guess i might believ anyth what the scoop on thi standalon drive activ everi sec i can onli comment on thermal recalibr in gener some new drive perform it in order to increas overal integr of data write basic the firmwar instruct the actuat to perform a test to see if the data track ar within a certain physic toler sinc when the media heat up or cool down some track drift is inevit and the drive ha to monitor it thi becom especi critic at veri high record densiti and so wa us primarili on veri larg capac mechan but it seem to be find it wai into more smaller drive as a wai of boost the drive s long term reliabl and mtbf rate i first becam awar of thermal recalibr when it wa point out that the techniqu conflict with prolong write time when digit sai audio or video to hard disk some manufactur explicitli state that drive with thermal recalibr ar not to be us for applic that have prolong disk write hope thi help victor
