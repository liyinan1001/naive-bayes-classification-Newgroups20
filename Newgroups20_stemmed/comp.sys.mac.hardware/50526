subject cannot move data fast enough i want to achiev an overal throughput rate of around megabyt sec for veri larg data transfer around mb i have a quadra i have a nubu network card that can pump data in to mac memori at mb s us block mode transfer i have a high speed disk arrai no asynchron pb call that can achiev mb s let s sai all transfer go from disk to buffer to network card it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer then transfer all the data from the buffer to card mb s then mb s result in an overal mb s too slow so i tri the follow scheme for an n megabyt transfer step load the st mb from disk to buffer step asynch send st mb out card load the nd mb from disk to buffer step asynch send nd mb out card load the rd mb from disk to buffer step n asynch send the n mb out card load the nth mb from disk to buffer step n send the nth mb out card even though the code appar doe execut the card transfer asynchron and the card doe not us the mac cpu at all it is us the buffer tho each of the step through n take as long as if the two transfer were execut on after anoth so there is no improv in the rate why is the mac ram dual port so the nubu card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time is the problem that the two devic card and disk driver both have to us the same bu to mac ram is there anyth i can do david david blume i get tire think of all the thing i dcb wdl wdl loral com don t want to do bukowski barfli
