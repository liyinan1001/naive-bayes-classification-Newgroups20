subject re x x how do thei compar in articl bd c a zeu ieee org michael amer f n z fidonet org michael amer write i believ it goe or will go powerpc pentium i think thi kind of comparison is pretti useless in gener the processor is onli good when a good comput is design around it adn the comput is us in it design purpos compar processor speed is pretti dumb becaus all you have to do is just increas the clock speed to increas speed among other thing i mean how can you sai a is faster than a without give is oper condit can you sai the same when you ar run a program that us a lot of transident function know that doe not have transident function build in to it fpu and doe can you sai that is still faster anywai i hope peopl do not decid upon wether a comput is good or not sole on it processor or how fast a processor is base on it name becaus on can alwai do a certain thing to a processor to speed it up but if we restrict our arguement to for exampl pure processor architectur issu or how on processor will work well and anoth will not base on it design then we can get somewher with our discuss chung yang in a resent articl in on of the macmag i think a mhz acceler wa slightli slower than a mhz accel but thi is us a system design for the so it stand to reason that a system design for an ie quadra would do better so overal i d figur or so along the same line the new powerpc stuff is suppos to run the system at the level of a fast quadra but system or whatev will allow time the speed of a in the powerpc base system and wait for the i think it lap the pentium pro life pro women michael amer internet michael amer f n z fidonet org
