subject re quadra clock chip followup i have replac the osz to mhz yesterdai and no trubl at all my quadra now work at mhz stabl for more than hour i have also tri a mhz osz but after hour my quadra di i am not sure what wa the reason for that but it is to riski to run it to fast most of your quadra should work at mhz without ani problem but a safeti tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrad dure my mhz test i damag my harddisk and had a hardtim to get it work again so onc again do a backup befor you start now the speedomet result after replac the osz speedomet report for mene rainer prepar april machin record version user comment quadra mhz and ram disk mbyte ram mbyte vram system inform comput mac quadra cpu mc fpu integr fpu mmu integr mmu color quickdraw bit qd system version finder version d appletalk version laserwrit version d laser prep version not found imagewrit version d rom version c rom size bit depth horizont dpi vertic dpi primari screen size x physic ram k logic ram k p r result us mac classic as cpu graphic disk name of hard disk test ram disk math perform rate pr benchmark result us mac classic as kwhetston dhryston tower quicksort bubbl sort queen puzzl permut fast fourier f p matrix multipli integ matrix multipli siev benchmark averag fpu test us mac ii as ffpu fast fourier fpu kwhetston fpu f p matrix mult fpu test averag color test us mac ii as black white color color color color test averag veri interest ar the graphic result graphic couldn t belief thi but it is true two point which my caus problem ar the mbyte ram solder on the board the ar onli ns ram and run at the upperlimit with mhz the next part which mai caus troubl ar the video ram i have the orign ns vram from appl in my quadra here you ar also at the upperlimit where most of the chip run but it isn t garanti to run most of the other part on the quadra board run on there o wn clockspe so thei wont make trubl the most importan question is do i neat a new heat sink i would sai no after run my quadra for more than hour the heat sink is realli cool a mhz with heat sink is mutch warmer than the in the quadra so i didn t see ani problem the room temperatur wa celsiu f if you live in a area were it is hot f c and your room temperatur is not mutch below i would suggest a new heat sink with a ventil to stai on the safe side hope you will have the same success than i had rainer email mene statistik tu muenchen de
