subject mac ibm info version send follow up to comp sy mac advocaci sorri about the header but the pnew here doe not let on easili chang the header and i gave up after a year of try thi sheet is also avail by ftp on sumex aim stanford edu in the info mac report as mac ibm compar txt mac ibm info version the reason for thi gener data sheet is to consolid and condens the inform out there so that peopl in both camp can be clear and accur about what thei ar sai about their machin sinc comput technolog is alwai chang there ar alwai go to be point in which the sheet will be lack or incorrect on inform so pleas just don t sai the sheet is incomplet or incorrect but also give me clear and concis inform to make the need correct all price ar in us dollar to keep thi data sheet organ pleas provid if possibl articl citat for the inform provid or correct and keep the opinion to a minimum as thi is a gener data sheet keep the info provid simpl so i can understand what is be talk about and can explain it to other final keep the inform relev to the section correct for exampl os code in rom is softwar contain in hardwar so no more of the but it is support in os disk softwar data for the
