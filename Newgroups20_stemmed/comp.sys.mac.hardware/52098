subject iisi clock poll result long thi poll wa conduct to help user decid whether or not to alter their iisi clock oscil i have attempt to gather as mani case histori as possibl to find some estim of success and risk the number of repli probabl show how rare thi modif is but give the impress that success rate mai be higher than the previou estim of machin were abl to run at mhz when no add on board were present thi is not a scientif survei but it is the best we have to work with thank to all who contribut to thi poll issu speed mhz to mhz appear to be the norm for machin without add on card all report machin were abl to us mhz as long as no add on card were present sever appl nubu card were in us no machin with the nubu adapt wa abl to go faster than mhz on wasn t even abl to achiev mhz with the nubu adapt in place at speed of and mhz the startup sound is distort and hi densiti floppi disk problem have been report note unless specif list below machin were not test with a higher speed clock to failur henc the mhz oper machin mai well work at higher speed damag on user report pull out the plate of on pad thi wa repair and the machin is oper on other report pull the pin out of the origin clock oscil dure desold there is on second hand report of a user put a gash in the motherboard with a slip solder iron no report of static discharg damag no report of high speed oper caus damag then again i also don t have ani report from user of defect parachut add on board compat appear to be a problem with appl nubu adapt sever other add on board have been us with success see case histori heat sink virtual all modifi machin had a heat sink instal these were often the to style power transistor type some us epoxi some us a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacryl glue there wa also us of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the motherboard case histori all speed ar the effect cpu speed of clock oscil all report cpu version were mhz mhz oper ran for minut at mhz befor crash no fpu or other add on card heatsink cpu onli on hour dai no damag dure instal mhz oper without appl nubu adapt mhz top speed with appl nubu card instal heatsink cpu onli on hour dai no floppi problem no damag dure instal mhz oper unabl to boot at mhz heatsink cpu onli no floppi problem no damag dure instal mhz oper work with the follow two configur a realtech fpu adaptor card realtech cach card supermac pdqsi b supermac fpu adaptor card supermac video spigot supermac pdqsi mhz oper fuzzi startup sound problem with hi densiti disk mhz oper fuzzi startup sound heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu mhz oper occasion crash at mhz mhz oper us fpu rate at mhz without difficulti mhz oper pd adapt with a spectrum pdqsi graphic card and a videospigot a mhz fpu heat sink on cpu mhz oper mhz fail after sever hour mhz oper quicksilv fpu onli upgrad mhz oper tri mhz system won t start heat sink on cpu configur with realtech fpu adapt card supermac pdqsi realtech cach cpu on continu no problem floppi work fine at mb mhz mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu on hour per dai mhz oper heat sink on cpu cool fan no floppi problem at mhz mhz oper bomb soon after startup at mhz with nubu adapt mhz rate cpu ram ns in slot on motherboard mhz oper heat sink ad to cpu later no damag while unheatsink appl nubu adapt with fpu instal mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu mhz oper heat sink on cpu gui kuo guykuo u washington edu
