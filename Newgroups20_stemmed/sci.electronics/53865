subject re analog switch balanc demodul in articl msf skaro msf skaro as arizona edu michael fulbright write i am try to build a synchron demodul and i ve hit a snag in my applic i want to be abl to chang the gain of an op amp amplifi from to control via a digit input the most obviou wai i ve come up with is to us analog switch to adjust the gain of the op amp the onli analog switch i have experi with it the unfortun i want to switch an ac signal which goe from about v to v and the is onli for posit signal i have a carrier signal which vari between v and v i want to demodul an input signal by feed the input signal thru a amp with a gain of when the carrier is at v and thru a amp with a gain of when the carrier is v the output is then low pass filter i believ thi is call lock in detect as well as synchron demodul look at the thi is a tripl to transmiss gate analog multiplex with posit and neg power suppli can be run from a singl end suppli as well with dual suppli the logic input still rang from ground volt to vdd thi is a neat well i think so design for a switchabl polar amplifi input opamp output control x analog switch gnd all resistor ar equal valu when the analog switch is close the amp is invert gain of on with the switch open it is non invert gain of on you can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if thi hurt the balanc thi would show up as carrier feed through for high frequenc the slew rate of the opamp might caus problem especi if it isn t symmetr and it usual isn t paul elliott dsc optilink petaluma ca usa uunet pyramid tekbspa optilink elliott or elliott optilink com i us to think i wa indecis but now i m not so sure
