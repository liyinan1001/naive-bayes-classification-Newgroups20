subject re help with ultra long time in articl apr kuhub cc ukan edu wellison kuhub cc ukan edu write i have a project that wa droop in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design what i am look for is a stabl ultra long solid state timer what thei want to do is to place thi thing on the antart ic shelf and measur the amount of snow fall over a period of six week everi two week thei want to trip a selonoid to discharg differ color pellet by ga pressur out across the snow then by dig down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measur as thei come to the differ color pellet the problem is try to build a timer that would stand the cold degre and a power sourc that wouldn t drain i have look at the xr timer and the standard ne dual timer but thier temp spec won t go that low also two week equat to second per fire which mean on big time cap i have found farad ye farad cap that have a work voltag of volt and ar small in size but again the time of discharg at or lower degre isn t linear i wa think of us sever timer chain togeth to fire the selonid at the end of the time period but that blast cold and the drain on a batteri over six week is the pain on possibl would be to us solar panel but thi is dure the six month twilight anyon have ani good idea thank in advanc we firstli i would never consid try to make a on shot timer your f cap will have been design as a ram batteri substitut rather than for us in applic where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their perform in some respect is more akin to batteri than to a normal cap the other point is that big electro s ar usual rate with toler so calcul exactli what capacit you have particularli when consid the cold you should be look at design a micropow oscil and divid chain that roll over from zero to maximum count or vice versa onc everi second if you were to us someth like a hz clock you would need a divid chain of to give an error of less than on percent in the fire time over the six week period of cours you could trim the hz oscil to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscil remain exactli constant at is low anywai i would suspect that there would be far more battrei drain in fire the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit caveat i m not experienc in low temperatur electron so i can t guarante that thi or ani other approach is the best for inhospit condit johnh electron depart school of mpce macquari univers sydnei australia email johnh mpce mq edu au ph fax
