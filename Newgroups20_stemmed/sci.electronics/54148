subject re switch ps question anywai i ve built the basic up down convert with pretti good result effici but i m run into problem when i try to design build anyth that put out seriou amp i know it can be done i have some v a gut on my bench but someth puzzl me i m us a simpl choke as the storag element basicli a toroid with a singl wind but all commerci model us transform with mani wind i trace a few and thei seem to us some of the wind for the usual error feedback but some of the other seem to loos me what ar thei for better than that anyon have a full schemat for on of these that i could get a copi of i d love to see how thei manag to squeez out so much from such low volum most commerci switcher do not us magnet for their energi storag that s handl by the big cap on the primari side those which in a linearli regul power suppli would be consid the filter cap come right after the bridg the transform is just that a transform it s there primarili to step the voltag up or down although the induct seen by the switch transistor on the primari side is not neglig as anyon who s zap said transistor from either fail to get on with a high enough breakdown voltag or neglect to includ a snubber diod across it would tell you actual mani transistor intend for switcher us todai have the diod built in the basic switch mode power suppli oper someth like thi in a somewhat simplifi manner the ac line is rectifi to produc a high voltag more or less unregul dc rail the energi storag or filter cap appear across thi rail as doe the switch transistor the transistor chop the current into the primari side of the transform result in step up or step down puls out the secondari which ar then rectifi and filter at least on of the transform s output is sampl and fed back to the control circuit for the switch transistor which act in a puls width modul pwm fashion to control by vari the puls width the amount of energi be dump into the primari and therefor the voltag come out at the secondari the remain output mai be allow to simpli run at whatev valu thei will more or less track the regul output or thei mai have some addit linear regul ad you mai also note that the feedback between the regul output and the pwm control which is most typic an ic is not done via a direct electr connect thi is due to variou safeti standard which requir primari and secondari circuit to be electr isol often the feedback path involv an optoisol to meet thi requir while the transform isn t the primari energi storag devic in these design thi doe not mean that the energi store in the transform can be ignor besid the induct kick give the switch transistor a bad time as note abov you also need to worri about get all the energi that went in to the transform back out again on wai or anoth in some design thi happen more or less automat but in other you need to take special care to ensur that the transform core doesn t satur which again would have disastr result best left to the imagin i m not by ani stretch of the imagin a power suppli design hopefulli a real on will come along soon and clean up ani gross error in the abov bob myer kc ew hewlett packard co opinion express here ar not system technolog div those of my employ or ani other myer fc hp com fort collin colorado sentient life form on thi planet
