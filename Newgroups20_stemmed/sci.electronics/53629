subject re ic packag in articl apr sol ctr columbia edu seema madvlsi columbia edu seema varma write hi i am look for some help in choos a packag for a high speed silicon adc mhz current be fabric thi is a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughli packag circuit and will do dc low speed and high speed test us differ set up for the test chip i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead line have too high an induct get a custom made packag is too expens so i am try to choos between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test sinc it ha to be solder on to the test setup and i would spend load of time solder as i kept chang the test chip the leadless chip carrier socket also have long lead line and mai not work at high speed doe anyon out there have experi knowledg of thi field i would greatli appreci help ani idea name of compani manufactur holder socket packag would help p s the multi layer fanci gaa packag seem like a bit of overkil seema varma you didn t mention whether or not cost is an issu where exactli ar you run mhz the digit side ttl ecl we run mhz and mhz all over our ic test equip all dai long in the ecl domain and we us dip s along with plcc s mil and mil pitch pin qfp s to name a few i don t see a problem in packag as long as you adher to sound engin practic a good sourc of inform is motorola s mecl system design handbook the latest ed is date that is consid to be on of the bibl in high speed design the veri fact that you need to build a test fixtur mean you re most like go to need a socket it in itself ha far more induct per pin than the packag you ar test not to mention ani imped discontinu i don t see the big concern over the packag becaus it probabl isn t go to make that much differ if you re try to get ttl to run at mhz have fun ttl wa never design to run in a mhz environ aaron p s my opinion have noth to do with my compani the standard disclaim appli
