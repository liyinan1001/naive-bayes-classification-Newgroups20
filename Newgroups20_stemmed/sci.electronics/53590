subject re dumb question function gener output offset obtain the servic manual for the oscilloscop and adjust the intern output offset contorl there is virtual certainti that there is an intern ajust for the offset control s zero detent posit verifi that the function gener is properli load mani gener expect you to suppli a ohm load go to a hamfest flea market and scroung around for a pass through ohm termin that ha a male and femal bnc or whatev connector on it the calibr on my tektronix scope is design to put out v into a meg load but volt into a ohm load you mai also find that load the output of the function gener also reduc the harmon distort build an attenu you don t have to us and i wouldn t want to us the input imped of the devic under test as part of the voltag divid to drop the input test voltag consid thi k ohm gen ohm d u t load think about the ratio of k and then think about the accuraci to which you can read voltag on your oscilloscop you can virtual discount the load of the d u t also you have the millivolt test gener you want good luck bill mayhew neoucom comput servic depart rootstown oh usa phone wtm uhura neoucom edu n wed
