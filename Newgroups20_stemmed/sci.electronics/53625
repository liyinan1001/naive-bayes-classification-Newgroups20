subject re singl chip receiv for fsk john ackermann x jra law daytonoh ncr com wrote my next project is to come up with an if detector modul for fast to kb sec packet radio us no fanci modul scheme just wide fsk for us at or mhz i m a bit familiar with the motorola chip but i wonder if there ar newer design that might work at higher input frequenc my goal is to come up with an inexpens design for a receiv back end with if input on on end and an fsk demondul on the other i m particularli interest in wai to us a higher if than do ani current chip work up to sai mhz with intern downconvers so a normal if filter can be us ani suggest john what you describ is veri close to what i built and describ in the th arrl comput network confer proceed i built watt fsk transceiv at mhz thei ar essenti doubl convers transvert with digit mod and demod at mhz the receiv us the mc which is the same fsk receiv chip i us previouslyu in the mbp ghz data link i first publish in ham radio and which is now also in the arrl handbook the mc which includ a vhf convert section could also be us at these speed there is a newer and perhap slightli improv design of thi the mc if i rememb rightli while us thi would have let me reduc the extern if count on receiv it didn t realli offer all that much help on transmit so i didn t bother with it the radio i built were first design and built for kbp in a mhz channel but later reduc to half that these kbp radio actual have done quit well in across the bench test at kbp and speed is pretti much a function of filter design handl the data stream is anoth matter entir some of the exist radio ar current deploi on hilltop in a beacon test mode while there is not yet end end two wai data flow due to lack of resourc to debug softwar for the digit hardwar mio also shown in the cnc proceed data is perfect copi at n gn even though the data clock is current at about half speed the a kbyte of the test text chapter of isaiah take onli a littl over of a second i ve been hope that someon would get interest enough to step in and get involv in write code to make the whole thing usabl borland id environ with remot debug possibl as mention in the proceed but to date a coupl of us have been on our own and run low on resourc of time monei and energi if anyon in the sf bai area want to check it out there is also a cw id after the text on the mark side at mhz from beacon on sonoma mtn and black mtn overlook si vallei the antenna is horizont polar i guess in retrospect my suggest ar that thi is a fairli costli approach if the radio ar intend for user rather than backbon and you might want to carefulli consid your target if you can t arrang your path such that you have complet line of sight i think you ll want to address the inter symbol interfer caus by multipath and probabl link c n budget if path ar veri far from lo for more detail see the th cnc i m current work on a spread spectrum direct convers design to address some of these problem i d be glad to help as i can with ani design problem glenn elmor n gn n gn k mc amateur ip glenn santarosa ampr org internet glenn sr hp com
