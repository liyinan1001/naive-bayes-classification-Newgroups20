subject re what do nuclear site s cool tower do in c l x kj vcd hp com john eaton write dure the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt when thi happen the liquid uranium is pump to the cool tower where it is sprai into the air contact with the cool outsid air will condens the mist and it will fall back to the cool tower floor there it is collect by a clean crew us shop vac and is then reform into pellet for reactor us the next dai cool tower ar a lot taller than thei realli need to be power compani ar forc to make them that tall by some enviroment law that requir the raw uranium emis to be held to under thi law is now under attack by lawyer argu that the should be measur at the edg of the properti rather than the edg of the cool tower elimin thi law will save power compani thousand of dollar in concret cost for new nuke john eaton hp vcd john i think you post your articl dai too late april st is over i don t like nuclear powerpl but i think it s not fair to tell such stori about them ok let me try to explain what that tower is us to st even the modernst nuclear powerpl is onli a simpl steam engin it ha an hightech boiler but the rest is still verri verri convent and if you ve alreadi visit ani condens powerst you l have seen the cool tower too if you look at ani good book about thermophys you ll find a chapter about the carnot process which describ how to get energi from a temperatur differ and that is the reason for cool tower too you onli can get energi if you ve an temperatur gradient that mean that you have steam on the on side and need to cool down the steam till you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox of the energi you or better the uranium brought into the water to let it boil if you onli have hot steam on the on and cold steam on the other side you ll loos much more of the energi and so thei cool down the steam to get at least the of energi that carnot will give them the cool tower ar for cool the steam the vapor you ll see is not the steam of the main core circul becaus that steam is radioact the circul is divid in at least circuit connect about heat exchang to prevent radioact pollut of the environ nd ok the main core is hot but even in the modernst hightemperatur reactor htr thei onli run at deg celsiu thi is still verri far awai from uranium melt point which is somewher around deg celsiu but you ll have lot s of problem with the boiler s steel that s becaus at thi temperatur the metal is attack by steam and will corrod verri fast thi is onli for bwr s the new he cool reactor have temperatur up to deg celsiu but thi is onli experiment rd i personali think that nuclear wast should be as low as ever possibl becaus the dose you get will accumul about the year todai mrem and next year mrem won t be mrem at all it accumul and even in year you ll still have mrem and i m not interest in glow in the night and get children with head thi is my point of view onli my christian reisel student of electron scienc christian reisel goldammerweg w buebingen germani voic fax email pgp pubkei begin pcr pub mf l p s q es pl h fe ea ox p r f qy q sy dz l mmo k vh u mx g mf h kl m fi w t m q end
