and we cannot be respons for what you do if you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it contact someon qualifi a licens electrician or your local electr inspector electr is no joke mistak can result in shock fire or electrocut furthermor our discuss is base on the u s nation electr code nec and the canadian electr code cec to the best of our abil we have confirm everi detail with the electr code but we don t quot section simpli to keep thi thing readabl if you think we re wrong we invit you to correct us but pleas quot refer the nec and the cec do not in and of themselv have the forc of law mani municip adopt it en toto other howev do not check your with your local build depart and provinci hydro inspect offic in canada to find out what appli in your area also your local electr util mai also have special requir for electr servic instal bear in mind too that we sai here appli primarili to ordinari singl famili resid multi famili dwell mobil home commerci establish etc ar sometim govern by differ rule also note that contrari to popular belief in the u s and in some part of canada canada is not a wholli own subsidiari of the u s consequ the nec doe not appli in canada lot of thing ar the same includ voltag line frequenc and the law of physic but there ar a number of crucial differ in the regul where we can we ve note them flag the relev passag with nec or cec rememb that the cec and nec ar minim standard it is often smart to go beyond their minim requir subject what is the nec where can i get a copi the nec is a model electr code devis and publish by the nation fire protect associ an insur industri group it s revis everi three year the version ha been releas you can bui a copi at a decent bookstor or by call them directli at

contain the author commentari on the code as well as the full text that s the recommend version unfortun there s no handbook for the abridg edit and the full handbook is expens us plu ship and handl subject what is the cec where can i get a copi the canadian standard associ is an organ made up of variou govern agenc power util insur compani electr manufactur and other organ the csa publish csa standard c which is updat everi two or three year each provinc adopt with some amend thi standard and publish a provinc specif code book sinc each provinc publish it own slightli modifi standard it would be somewhat confus to obtain the csa standard itself in thi faq cec realli mean the appropri provinci standard in particular thi faq is deriv from the ontario hydro electr safeti code th edit which is in turn base on csa c th edit while differ exist between the provinc an attempt ha been made to avoid specif to ontario detail the appropri provinci code can be obtain from electr inspect offic of your provinci power author in ontario it s ontario hydro the ontario hydro book isn t overli fat it s about c and includ mail updat i hear that these standard ar somewhat easier to read than the equival nec public don t bother ask in quebec dii wire is ban throughout the provinc subject can i do my own wire extra pointer in most place homeown ar allow to do their own wire in some thei re not check with your local electr inspector most place won t permit you to do wire on other s home for monei without a licens nor ar you permit to do wire in commerci build multipl dwell eg duplex ar usual consid semi commerci or commerci howev mani jurisdict will permit you to work on semi commerci wire if you re supervis by a licens electrician if you can find on will to supervis if you do your own wire an import point do it neat and well what you realli want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do after all it s your own home and it s you or your famili that might get kill if you make a mistak an electrician ha time pressur ha the skill and know the trick of the trade to do a fast safe job in thi faq we ve conscious given a few recommend that ar in excess of code becaus we feel that it s reason and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that you re an amateur you have to earn hi trust the best wai of do thi is to spend your time do as neat a job as possibl don t cut corner exce specif otherwis the inspector mai get extrem picki and fault you on the slightest transgress don t try to hide anyth from the inspector us the proper tool ie don t us a bread knife to strip wire or twist wire with your finger the inspector won t like it and the result won t be that safe and it take longer and you re more like to stick a hunk of ga wire through your hand that wai don t handl hous wire when it s veri cold eg below c or f thermoplast hous wire particularli older type becom veri brittl subject what do i need in the wai of tool first there s the obviou a hammer a drill a few screwdriv both straight and phillip head if you re lucki enough to live in canada or find a sourc of csa approv devic you need robertson squar recess screwdriv and instead of phillip for drill a few hole a or spade bit and or electr drill will do if you re do a lot or ar work with elderli lumber we recommend a drill right angl drill ar wonder can be rent and or screw point auger drill bit these bit pull you through so thei re much faster and less fatigu even in year old hardwood timber screw driver bit ar us for drill expeci if you instal your electr box us screw drywal screw work well for strip wire us a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinari wire cutter don t bui the k mart combo stripper crimper and bottl open type you should expect to pai to for a good plier type pair it will have size strip hole and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easi to strip wire with it on model ha a small hole in the blade for form exact wire loop for screw termin there ar fancier type autostrip cut but thei gener aren t necessari and pro usual don t us them a pair of diagon side cutter plier ar us for clip end in constrict place don t us these for strip wire you will need linesman plier for twist wire for wire nut you should have a pair of needl nose plier for fiddl insid box and close loop but it s better to form wire loop with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accur if you re us non metal cabl get a cabl stripper for remov the sheath or do what some pro do thei nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of plier and simpli rip the sheath back us the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off you shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point becaus it s too easi to slash the insul on the conductor appar stanlei util knive fit with linoleum cutter hook blade can be us to strip sheath but there is still the possibl that you ll goug the conductor for ani substanti amount of work with armor cabl it s well worth your while to invest in a rotari cabl splitter us hack saw ar tricki to us without cut into the wire or the insul three prong outlet tester ar a quick check for properli wire outlet about multimet tell you more but ar a lot more expens and probabl not worth it for most peopl a simpl voltag sensor which can detect potenti through an insul wire not suppli ani devic is extrem help thei cost about us at radio shack you should have a voltag detector to check that the wire ar dead befor do work on them neon bulb version ar cheap and work well if you get more seriou a audibl alarm type is good for trace circuit without a helper though i ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breaker until the scream stop for run wire through exist wall you need fish tape often two tape ar need though sometim a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffic fish tape can be rent electr tape lot of it serious a good and compet wire job will need veri littl tape the tape is us for wrap dici insul in repair work anoth us is to wrap around the bodi of outlet and switch to cover the termin screw i don t do thi but drywal contractor prefer it to prevent explos when the drywal knife collid with a live outlet that ha no cover plate subject what is ul list the ul stand for underwrit laboratori it us to be an insur industri organ but now it is independ and non profit it test electr compon and equip for potenti hazard when someth is ul list that mean that the ul ha test the devic and it meet their requir for safeti ie fire or shock hazard it doesn t necessarili mean that the devic actual doe what it s suppos to just that it probabl won t kill you the ul doe not have power of law in the u s you ar permit to bui and instal non ul list devic howev insur polici sometim have claus in them that will limit their liabil in case of a claim made in respons to the failur of a non ul list devic furthermor in mani situat the nec will requir that a wire compon us for a specif purpos is ul list for that purpos indirectli thi mean that certain part of your wire must be ul list befor an inspector will approv it and or occup permit issu subject what is csa approv everi electr devic or compon must be certifi by the canadian standard associ befor it can be sold in canada implicit in thi is that all wire must be done with csa approv materi thei perform test similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approv is requir by law again like the ul if a fire wa caus by non csa approv equip your insur compani mai not have to pai the claim in canada there is a branch organ of the ul call ulc ul of canada ulc doe not have power of law and seem to be more a liason group between the csa and insur compani subject ar there ani cheaper easier to read book on wire usa the follow three book were suggest by our reader residenti wire by jeff markel craftsman book carlsbad ca for isbn practic electr wire residenti farm and industri base on the nation electr code ansi nfpa herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co wire simplifi h p richter and w c schwan park publish co try to make sure that the book is base on the latest nec revis which is current canada p s knight author and publish a book call electr code simplifi there appear to be a version publish specif to each provinc and is veri ti into the appropri provinci code it focus on residenti wire and is indispens for canadian dii er it is better to get thi book than the cec unless you do a lot of wire or answer question on the net it is updat each time the provinci code ar thi book is avail at all dii and hardwar store for less than c subject inspect how and what why should i get my wire inspect most jurisdict requir that you obtain a permit and inspect of ani wire that is done amongst other more mundan bureaucrat reason like insur compani not like to have to pai claim a permit and inspect provid some assur that you your famili your neighbor or subsequ owner of your home don t get kill or lose their home on night due to a sloppi wire job most jurisdict have the power to order you to vacat your home or order you to tear out ani wire done without a permit california for instanc is particularli nasti about thi if fire start in your home and un inspect wire is at fault insur compani will often refus to pai the damag claim in gener the process goe like thi you appli to your local inspect offic or build depart for a permit you should have a sketch or detail draw of what you plan on do thi is a good time to ask question on ani thing you re not sure of if you re do major work thei mai impos special condit on you requir load calcul and ask other question at thi point thei will tell you which inspect you will need if you re instal a main panel you will need to have the panel and servic connect inspect befor your power util will provid a connect thi is sometim done by the local power author rather than the usual inspector after instal the box and wire but befor the insul wall go up you will need a rough in inspect after the wall ar up and the wire is complet you will need a final inspect subject my hous doesn t meet some of these rule and regul do i have to upgrad in gener there is no requir to upgrad older dwell though there ar some except ie smoke detector in some case howev ani new work must be done accord to the latest electr code also if you do major work you mai be requir to upgrad certain exist portion or all of your system check with your local electr inspector subject a word on voltag on thing where thing might get a bit confus is the differ number peopl bandi about for the voltag of a circuit on person might talk about v anoth v or anoth v these ar all in fact exactli the same thing in north america the util compani ar requir to suppli a split phase volt feed to your hous thi work out as two v leg addition sinc there ar resist voltag drop in the hous wire it s not unreason to find v ha drop to v or v ha drop to v by the time the power reach a wall outlet especi at the end of an extens cord or long circuit run for a number of reason some histor some simpl person ornery differ peopl choos call them by slightli differ number thi faq ha chosen to be consist with call them v and v except when actual sai what the measur voltag will be confus a bit just ignor it on thing that might make thi a littl more understand is that the namepl on equip ofen show the lower ie v instead of v valu what thi impli is that the devic is design to oper properli when the voltag drop that low v is not the same as v v is the voltag between phase of a phase y circuit that is v from neutral to ani hot v is the voltag between phase of a phase y circuit that s v from hot to neutral in keep with v versu v strang motor intend to run on v three phase ar often label as v subject what doe an electr servic look like there ar logic four wire involv with suppli the main panel with power three of them will come from the util pole and a fourth bare wire come from elsewher the bare wire is connect to on or more long metal bar pound into the ground or to a wire buri in the foundat or sometim to the water suppli pipe ha to be metal continu to where the main water pipe enter the hous watch out for galvan action conduct break often between copper and iron pipe thi is the ground conductor it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlet is connect to ground thi wire normal carri no current on of the other wire will be white or black with white or yellow stripe or sometim simpli black it is the neutral wire it is connect to the centr tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribut transform suppli the power it is connect to the ground conductor in onli on place often insid the panel the neutral and ground should not be connect anywher els otherwis weird and or danger thing mai happen furthermor there should onli be on ground system in a home some code requir more than on ground electrod these will be connect togeth or connect to the neutral at a common point still on ground system ad addit ground electrod connect to other portion of the hous wire is unsaf and contrari to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral ar usual brought as separ conductor from the main panel and ar not connect togeth in the subpanel ie still onli on neutral ground connect howev in some situat certain categori of separ build you actual do have to provid a second ground electrod consult your inspector the other two wire will usual be black and ar the hot wire thei ar attach to the distribut transform as well the two black wire ar degre out of phase with each other thi mean if you connect someth to both hot wire the voltag will be volt if you connect someth to the white and either of the two black you will get v some panel seem to onli have three wire come into them thi is either becaus the neutral and ground ar connect togeth at a differ point eg the meter or pole and on wire is do dual duti as both neutral and ground or in some rare occas the servic ha onli on hot wire v onli servic subject what is a circuit insid the panel connect ar made to the incom wire these connect ar then us to suppli power to select portion of the home there ar three differ combin on hot on neutral and ground v circuit two hot no neutral and ground v circuit two hot neutral and ground v circuit neutral and or two v circuit with a common neutral is us for most circuit suppli receptacl and light within your hous is usual us for suppli power to major applianc such as stove and dryer thei often have need for both v and v or for bring sever circuit from the panel box to a distribut point is usual for special v motor circuit electr heater or air condition note in the us the nec frequent permit a circuit similar to be us for stove and dryer name that there ar two hot wire and a wire that doe dual duti as neutral and ground and is connect to the frame as well as provid the neutral for v purpos three prong plug instead of four onli for stove dryer connect to the main panel when connect to most sub panel prong plug and receptacl ar requir in our not so humbl opinion thi is crazi but the nfpa claim that thi practic wa re evalu for the nec and found to be safe check your local code or inquir as to local practic there ar restrict on when thi is permiss is usual wire with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for ground and have on hot wire colour red the other black a bare wire for ground and in a white wire for neutral you will sometim see wire with just a black white and ground wire sinc the white is hot in thi case both the nec and cec requir that the white wire be perman mark at the end to indic that it is a live wire usual done with paint nail polish or sometim electr tape each circuit is attach to the main wire come into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there ar in a few local circuit that look like or except that thei have two bare ground wire some place requir thi for hot tub and the like on ground is frame ground the other attach to the motor thi mai or mai not be an altern to gfci protect subject ground versu ground versu neutral accord to the terminolog in the cec and nec the ground conductor is for the safeti ground i e the green or bare wire the word neutral is reserv for the white when you have a circuit with more than on hot wire sinc the white wire is connect to neutral and the ground conductor insid the panel the proper term is ground conductor howev the potenti confus between ground conductor and ground conductor can lead to potenti lethal mistak you should never us the bare wire as a ground conductor or white wire as the ground conductor even though thei ar connect togeth in the panel but not in subpanel subpanel ar fed neutral and ground separ from the main panel usual in the trade and in common usag the word neutral is us for ground conductor thi faq us neutral simpli to avoid potenti confus we recommend that you us neutral too thu the white wire is alwai except in some light switch applic neutral not ground subject what doe a fuse or breaker do what ar the differ fuse and circuit breaker ar design to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exce safe level for exampl if your toaster short out a fuse or breaker should trip protect the wire in the wall from melt as such fuse and breaker ar primarili intend to protect the wire ul or csa approv supposedli indic that the equip itself won t caus a fire fuse contain a narrow strip of metal which is design to melt safe when the current exce the rate valu therebi interrupt the power to the circuit fuse trip rel fast which can sometim be a problem with motor which have larg startup current surg for motor circuit you can us a time delai fuse on brand is fusetron which will avoid trip on momentari overload a fusetron look like a spring load fuse a fuse can onli trip onc then it must be replac breaker ar fairli complic mechan devic thei usual consist of on spring load contact which is latch into posit against anoth contact when the current flow through the devic exce the rate valu a bimetal strip heat up and bend by bend it trip the latch and the spring pull the contact apart circuit breaker behav similarli to fusetron that is thei tend to take longer to trip at moder overload than ordinari fuse with high overload thei trip quickli breaker can be reset a finit number of time each time thei trip or ar thrown when the circuit is in us some arc take place which damag the contact thu breaker should not be us in place of switch unless thei ar special list for the purpos neither fuse nor breaker limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can caus hundr or sometim even thousand of amper to flow for a short period of time which can often caus sever damag subject breaker can t i us fuse statist show that fuse panel have a significantli higher risk of caus a fire than breaker panel thi is usual due to the fuse be loos screw in or the contact corrod and heat up over time or the wrong size fuse be instal or the proverbi replac the fuse with a penni trick sinc breaker ar more perman instal and have better connect mechan the risk of fire is consider less fuse ar prone to explod under extrem high overload when a fuse explod the metal vapor cloud becom a conduct path result from complet meltdown of the electr panel melt servic wire through fire in the electr distribut transform and have your hous burn down breaker don t do thi mani jurisdict particularli in canada no longer permit fuse panel in new instal the nec doe permit new fuse panel in some rare circumst requir the special insert to kei the fusehold to specif size fuse some devic notabl certain larg air condition requir fuse protect in addit to the breaker at the panel the fuse is there to protect the motor wind from overload check the label on the unit thi is usual onli on larg perman instal motor the instal instruct will tell you if you need on subject what size wire should i us for a amp circuit us gaug wire for a amp circuit you can us gaug wire in most local for a long run though you should us the next larger size wire to avoid voltag drop gaug is onli slightli more expens than gaug though it s stiffer and harder to work with here s a quick tabl for normal situat go up a size for more than foot run when the cabl is in conduit or gang with other wire in a place where thei can t dissip heat easili gaug amp we don t list bigger size becaus it start get veri depend on the applic and precis wire type subject where do these number come from there ar two consider voltag drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resist is when the resist is higher the wire heat up more and there is more voltag drop in the wire the former is why you need higher temperatur insul and or bigger wire for us in conduit the latter is why you should us larger wire for long run neither effect is veri signific over veri short distanc there ar some veri specif except where us of smaller wire is allow the obviou on is the line cord on most lamp don t try thi unless you re certain that your us fit on of those except you can never go wrong by us larger wire subject what doe mean thi is us to describ the size and quantiti of conductor in a cabl the first number specifi the gaug the second the number of current carri conductor in the wire but rememb there s usual an extra ground wire mean gaug two insul current carri wire plu bare ground wire usual ha a black white and bare ground wire sometim the white is red instead for v circuit without neutral in the latter case the sheath is usual red too wire usual ha a black red white and bare ground wire usual carri v with neutral subject what is a wirenut marrett marr connector how ar thei us a wire nut is a cone shape thread plastic thingummi that s us to connect wire togeth marrett or marr connector ar trade name you ll usual us a lot of them in dii wire in essenc you strip the end of the wire about an inch twist them togeth then twist the wirenut on though some wirenut advertis that you don t need to twist the wire do it anywai it s more mechan and electr secur there ar mani differ size of wire nut you should check that the wire nut you re us is the correct size for the quantiti and size of wire you re connect togeth don t just gimbl the wire togeth with a pair of plier or your finger us a pair of blunt nose linesman plier and carefulli twist the wire tightli and neatli sometim it s a good idea to trim the result end to make sure it goe in the wirenut properli some peopl wrap the open end of the wirenut with electr tape thi is probabl not a good idea the inspector mai tear it off dure an inspect it s usual done becaus a bit of bare wire is expos outsid the wire nut instead of tape it the connect should be redon subject what is a gfi gfci a gfci is a ground fault circuit interrupt it measur the current current flow through the hot wire and the neutral wire if thei differ by more than a few milliamp the presumpt is that current is leak to ground via some other path thi mai be becaus of a short circuit to the chassi of an applianc or to the ground lead or through a person ani of these situat is hazard so the gfci trip break the circuit gfci do not protect against all kind of electr shock if for exampl you simultan touch the hot and neutral lead of a circuit and no part of you wa ground a gfci wouldn t help all of the current that pass from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keep the gfci happi the two pair of connect on a gfci outlet ar not symmetr on is label load the other line the incom power feed must be connect to the line side or the outlet will not be protect the load side can be us to protect all devic downstream from it thu a whole string of outlet can be cover by a singl gfci outlet subject where should gfci be us the nec mandat gfci for v a or a singl phase outlet in bathroom kitchen within of the sink garag unfinish basement or crawl space outdoor near a pool or just about anywher els where you re like to encount water or damp there ar except for inaccess outlet those dedic to applianc occupi fix space typic refriger and freezer and for sump pump and laundri applianc the cec doe not mandat as mani gfci in particular there is no requir to protect kitchen outlet or most garag or basement outlet basement outlet must be protect if you have a dirt floor garag outlet if thei re near the door to outsid bathroom and most exterior outlet must have gfci even if you ar not requir to have gfci protect you mai want to consid instal it anywai unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low in the u s gfci outlet can cost as littl as us cost ar a bit higher in canada c evalu your own risk factor doe your finish basement ever get wet do you have small children do you us your garag outlet to power outdoor tool doe water or melt snow ever puddl insid your garag subject where shouldn t i us a gfci gfci ar gener not us on circuit that a don t pose a safeti risk and b ar us to power equip that must run unattend for long period of time refriger freezer and sump pump ar good exampl the rational is that gfci ar sometim prone to nuisanc trip some peopl claim that the induct delai in motor wind can caus a momentari current imbal trip the gfci note though that most gfci trip ar real if you re get a lot of trip for no appar reason you d be well advis to check your wire befor decid that the gfci is broken or useless subject what is the differ between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker for most situat you can us either a gfci outlet as the first devic on the circuit or you can instal a breaker with a built in gfci the former is gener prefer sinc gfci breaker ar quit expens for exampl an ordinari ge breaker cost us the gfci model cost us there is on major except if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit two or more circuit share a common neutral wire such as a canadian style kitchen circuit you ll need a multi pole gfci breaker unfortun these ar expens the cost can rang into the hundr of dollar depend on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit sai for a pool heater you have no choic on more caveat gfci outlet ar bulki you mai want to us an overs box when instal them on second thought us larg actual deep box everywher you ll thank yourself for it incident if you re instal a gfci to ensur that on specif outlet is protect such as a bathroom you don t realli have to go to all of the troubl to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simpli find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anyth upstream of it but protect the whole circuit is prefer when you instal a gfci it s a good idea to us the littl ground fault protect sticker that come with it and mark the outlet downstream of the gfci you can figur out which outlet ar downstream simpli by trip the gfci with the test button and see which outlet ar dead subject what s the purpos of the ground prong on an outlet then apart from their us in electron which we won t comment on and for certain fluoresc light thei won t turn on without a good ground connect thei re intend to guard against insul failur within the devic gener the case of the applianc is connect to the ground lead if there s an insul failur that short the hot lead to the case the ground lead conduct the electr awai safe and possibl trip the circuit breaker in the process if the case is not ground and such a short occur the case is live and if you touch it while you re ground you ll get zap of cours if the circuit is gfci protect it will be a veri tini zap which is why you can us gfci to replac unground outlet both nec and cec there ar some applianc that should never be ground in particular that appli to toaster and anyth els with expos conductor consid if you touch the heat electrod in a toaster and you re not ground noth will happen if you re slightli ground you ll get a small shock the resist will be too high but if the case were ground and you were hold it you d be the perfect path to ground subject why is on prong wider than the other polar nowadai mani two prong devic have on prong wider than the other thi is so that the devic could reli not guarante on on specif wire be neutral and the other hot thi is particularli advantag in light fixtur where the the shell should neutral safeti or other devic which want to have an approxim ground refer ie some radio most prong extens cord have wide prong too thi requir that you wire your outlet and plug the right wai around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow on hot most outlet have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter colour screw for the neutral if not you can usual figur out which is which by which prong the termin screw connect to subject what kind of outlet do i need in a kitchen the nec requir at least two amp small applianc circuit for kitchen the cec requir split duplex receptacl outlet must be instal such that no point is more than nec mm cec from an outlet everi counter wider than nec or mm cec must have at least on outlet the circuit these outlet ar on mai not feed ani outlet except in the kitchen pantri or dine room furthermor these circuit ar in addit to ani requir for refriger stove microwav light etc non dedic outlet within of a sink must be protect by a gfci nec onli split duplex receptacl ar fed with a v circuit the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and on hot goe to the upper outlet and the other hot goe to the lower outlet the neutral connect to both outlet through on screw when carri through to anoth outlet the neutral must be pigtail such that remov the outlet or have the neutral connect fall off doesn t caus the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlet subject where must outlet and switch be in bathroom there must be at least on outlet in each bathroom

subject can i instal a replac light fixtur in gener on can replac fixtur freeli subject to a few caveat first of cours on should check the amperag rate of the circuit if your heart is set on instal half a dozen watt floodlight you mai need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there ar some more subtl constraint as well for exampl older hous wire doesn t have high temperatur insul the excess heat gener by a ceil mount lamp can and will caus the insul to deterior and crack with obviou bad result some newer fixtur ar specif mark for high temperatur wire onli you mai find in fact that your ceil wire alreadi ha thi problem in which case replac ani devic is a real adventur other concern includ provid a suitabl ground for some fluoresc fixtur and make sure that the ceil box and it mount ar strong enough to support the weight of a heavi chandeli or ceil fan you mai need to instal a new box specif list for thi purpos a x across the ceil joist make a good support metal bracket ar also avail that can be fish into ceil thru the junction box hole and mount between the joist there ar special rule for recess light fixtur such as pot lamp or heat lamp when these ar instal in insul ceil thei can present a veri substanti fire hazard the cec provid for the instal of pot lamp in insul ceil provid that the fixtur is box in a coffin usual x x made by make a pair of joist high and cover with plywood that doesn t have ani insul ye that s feet long nec rule ar somewhat less stringent thei requir at least clearanc between the fixtur and ani sort of thermal insul the rule also sai that on should not obstruct free air movement which mean that a cec style coffin might be worthwhil presum that s up to the local inspector the cec doesn t actual mandat the coffin per se thi seem to be an inspector requir to make absolut certain that the fixtur can t get accident buri in insul ie if you have insul blown in later there ar now fixtur that contain integr thermal cutout and fairli larg case that can be buri directli in insul thei ar usual limit to watt bulb and ar unfortun somewhat more expens than the older type befor you us them you should ensur that thei have explicit ul or csa approv for such us follow the instal instruct carefulli the prescrib locat for the sensor can vari there doe not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixtur that is approv for us in insul the coffin appear the onli legal approach subject what doe it mean when the light brighten when a motor start thi usual mean that the neutral wire in the panel is loos depend on the load balanc on hot wire mai end up be more than v and the other less than v with respect to ground thi is a veri hazard situat it can destroi your electron equip possibl start fire and in some situat electrocut you ie some us jurisdict requir the stove frame connect to neutral if thi happen contact your electr author immedi and have them come and check out the problem note a brief second brighten is sometim normal with light and motor on the same v with neutral circuit a loos main panel neutral will usual show increas bright far longer than on second in case of doubt get help subject what is phase power should i us it can i get it in my hous three phase power ha three hot wire degre out of phase with each other these ar usual us for larg motor becaus it is more effici provid a bit more start torqu and becaus the motor ar simpler and henc cheaper you re most like to encount a phase circuit that show volt between ani hot and ground and volt between ani two hot the latter show the differ between a normal v v common neutral circuit which is volt between the two hot there ar phase circuit with differ voltag bring in a phase feed to your hous is usual ridicul expens or imposs if the equip you want to run ha a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to bui a new v or v motor for it in some case it is possibl to run phase equip on ordinari power if you have a capacitor start unit or us a larger motor as a auto gener these ar tricki but ar a good solut if the motor is non standard size or too expens or too big to replac the taunton press book the small shop ha an articl on how to do thi if you must note that you lose ani possibl electr effici by us such a convert the law of thermodynam guarante that subject is it better to run motor at or theoret it doesn t make ani differ howev there is a differ is the amount of power lost in the suppli wire all thing be equal a v motor will lose time less power in the hous wire than a v motor thi also mean that the startup surg loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumst the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life thi is usual irrelev unless the suppli wire ar more than feet long subject what is thi nonsens about hp on v a circuit it is a univers physic law that hp is equal to watt given heat loss power factor and other ineffici it is usual best to consid hp is go to need watt a v a circuit can onli deliv watt to a motor so it cannot possibl be more than approxim hp given ration effici factor hp is more like it some equip manufactur sear in particular most router manufactur in gener advertis a hp rate that is far in excess of what is possibl thei ar give you a stall horsepow or similar that mean the power is measur when the motor is just about to stop turn becaus of the load what thei don t mention is that if you kept it in that condit for more than a few second hopefulli your breaker will trip otherwis the motor will melt it s draw far more current than it can continu when compar motor compar the continu horsepow thi should be on the motor namepl if you can t find that figur check the amperag rate which is alwai present subject how do i convert two prong receptacl to three prong older home frequent have two prong receptacl instead of the more modern three these receptacl have no safeti ground and the cabl usual ha no ground wire neither the nec or cec permit instal new prong receptacl anymor there ar sever differ approach to solv thi if the wire is done through conduit or bx and the conduit is continu back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacl to the receptacl box nec mainli cec frown on thi practis if there is a copper cold water pipe go nearbi and it s continu to the main hous ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong run a ground conductor back to the main panel easiest instal a gfci receptacl the ground lug should not be connect to anyth but the gfci protect itself will serv instead the gfci will also protect downstream possibl also two prong outlet if you do thi to protect downstream outlet the ground must not be connect togeth sinc it wouldn t be connect to a real ground a wire fault could energ the case of prong devic connect to other outlet be sure though that there aren t indirect ground plug connect such as via the sheath on bx cabl the cec permit you to replac a two prong receptacl with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non conduct goop like caulk compound thi is not permit in the nec subject ar you sure about gfci and unground outlet should the test button work we re sure about what the nec and cec sai rememb though that your local code mai vari as for the test button there s a resistor connect the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button current through thi resistor show up as an imbal and trip the gfci thi is a simpl passiv and reliabl test and doesn t requir a real ground to work if your gfci doe not trip when you press the test button it is veri probabl defect or miswir again if the test button doesn t work someth s broken and potenti danger the problem should be correct immedi the instruct that come with some gfci specifi that the ground wire must be connect we do not know why thei sai thi the caus mai be as mundan as an old instruct sheet or with the formal of ul or csa list perhap the devic wa never test without the ground wire be connect on the other hand ul or csa approv should onli have been grant if the devic behav properli in all list applic includ unground outlet replac on of us call leviton their gfci ar label for instal on ground circuit onli the technician wa surpris to see that he agre that the nec doe not requir it and promis to investig subject how should i wire my shop as with ani other kind of wire you need enough power for all devic that will be on simultan the code specifi that you should stai under of the nomin capac of the circuit for typic home shop us thi mean on circuit for the major power tool and possibl on for a dust collector or shop vac us at least gaug wire mani power tool have big motor with a big start up surg if you can us amp breaker nec though cec requir standard a receptacl which mean you d have to replug all your equip light should either be on a circuit of their own and not share with circuit in the rest of the hous or be on at least two separ circuit the idea is that you want to avoid a situat where a blade is still spin at sever thousand rpm while you re grope in the dark for the off switch do instal lot of outlet it s easier to instal them in the begin when you don t have to cut into an exist cabl it s us if at least two circuit ar access at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you realli want but us metal box and plate and mayb even metal sheath cabl you mai have object fly around at high speed if someth goe a bit wrong note that some jurisdict have a no horizont wire rule in workshop or other unfinish area that ar us for work what thi mean is that all wire must be run along structur member ie stapl to stud other possibl shop circuit includ heater circuit v circuit for some larg tool and air compressor circuit don t overload circuit and don t us extens cord if you can help it unless thei re rate for high current a coil extens cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gaug also the insul won t withstand as much heat and heat dissip is the critic issu if your shop is locat at some remov from your main panel you should probabl instal a subpanel and deriv your shop wire from it if you have young children you mai want to equip thi panel with a cut off switch and possibl a lock if you want to instal individu switch to safe particular circuit make sure you get on rate high enough for exampl ordinari light switch ar not safe abl to handl the start up surg gener by a tabl saw bui horsepow rate switch instead final note that most home shop ar in garag or unfinish basement henc the nec requir for gfci appli and even if you know that you d never us on of your shop outlet to run a lawn mower the next owner of your hous might have a differ idea note fine woodwork magazin often carri articl on shop wire april is on place to start subject underground wire you will need to prepar a trench to specif us special wire protect the wire with

via conduit all outdoor box must be specif list for the purpos and contain the appropri gasket fit etc if the locat of the box is subject to immers in water a more seriou style of water proof box is need and of cours don t forget the gfci the requir depth and other detail vari from jurisdict to jurisdict so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specif situat a hint bui a roll of bright yellow tape that sai buri power line and buri it a few inch abov where the wire ha been place subject aluminum wire dure the s aluminum instead of copper wire becam quit popular and wa extens us sinc that time aluminum wire ha been implic in a number of hous fire and most jurisdict no longer permit it in new instal we recommend even if you re allow to that do not us it for new wire but don t panic if your hous ha aluminum wire aluminum wire when properli instal can be just as safe as copper aluminum wire is howev veri unforgiv of improp instal we will cover a bit of the theori behind potenti problem and what you can do to make your wire safe the main problem with aluminum wire is a phenomenon known as cold creep when aluminum wire warm up it expand when it cool down it contract unlik copper when aluminum goe through a number of warm cool cycl it lose a bit of tight each time to make the problem wors aluminum oxidis or corrod when in contact with certain type of metal so the resist of the connect goe up which caus it to heat up and corrod oxid still more eventu the wire mai start get veri hot melt the insul or fixtur it s attach to and possibl even caus a fire sinc peopl usual encount aluminum wire when thei move into a hous built dure the s we will cover basic point of safe aluminum wire we suggest that if you re consid purchas a home with aluminum wire or have discov it later that you hire a licens electrician or inspector to check over the wire for the follow thing fixtur eg outlet and switch directli attach to aluminum wire should be rate for it the devic will be stamp with al cu or co alr the latter supersed the former but both ar safe these fixtur ar somewhat more expens than the ordinari on wire should be properli connect at least wai around the screw in a clockwis direct connect should be tight while repeat tighten of the screw can make the problem wors dure the inspect it would pai off to snug up each connect note that aluminum wire is still often us for the main servic entranc cabl it should be inspect push in termin ar an extrem hazard with aluminum wire ani connect us push in termin should be redon with the proper screw connect immedi there should be no sign of overh darken connect melt insul or bake fixtur ani such damag should be repair connect between aluminum and copper wire need to be handl special current canadian code requir that the wire nut us must be special mark for connect aluminum to copper the nec requir that the wire be connect togeth us special crimp devic with an anti oxid greas the tool and materi for the latter ar quit expens not practic to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool ani non rate receptacl can be connect to aluminum wire by mean of a short copper pigtail see abov show reason workmanship neat wire properli strip not nick wire etc if when consid purchas a home an inspect of the wire show no problem or onli on or two we believ that you can consid the wire safe if there ar sign of problem in mani place we suggest you look elsewher if the wrong receptacl ar us you can replac them with the proper type or us pigtail have thi profession done can rang from to per receptacl switch you can do thi yourself too subject i m bui a hous what should i do congratul but it s gener a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the hous for hidden gotcha not just for wire but plumb and structur as well if an inspect of the wire show no problem or onli on or two minor on we believ that you can consid the wire safe after ani minor problem ar fix if there ar sign of problem in mani place we suggest you look elsewher here s some hint on what to look for obviou non code wire can includ zip cord wire either conceal or nail to wall hot wire on the identifi neutral conductor without proper

wire go into them wire that pass through a closet instead of a wall or ceil backwrap ground wire subject what is thi weird stuff old style wire in the year sinc edison invent electr sever differ wire style have come and gone when you bui an older home you mai encount some of thi stuff thi section describ the old method and some of their idiosyncrasi the oldest wire system you re like to encount is call knob and tube k t it is made up of individu conductor with a cloth insul the wire ar run along side structur member eg joist or stud us ceram stand off knob wire is run through structur member us ceram tube connect were made by twist the wire togeth solder and wrap with tape sinc the hot and neutral were run separ the wire tend to be rather confus a neutral often run down the centr of each room with tap off to each fixtur the hot wire tend to run from on fixtur to the next in some case k t isn t colour code so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wire you ll see k t in home built as late as the s comment on k t the peopl instal k t were pretti paranoid about electr so the workmanship tend to be pretti good the wire insul and insul tend to stand up veri well most k t i ve seen for exampl is in quit good condit no ground ground is usual difficult to instal box ar small receptacl replac particularli with gfci can be difficult no bush on box either so wire chang need special attent to box entri sometim the neutral isn t balanc veri well between separ hot circuit so it is sometim possibl to overload the neutral without exceed the fuse on ani circuit build code doe not permit insul in wall that contain k t connect to exist k t from new circuit can be tricki consult your inspector modern wire practis requir consider more outlet to be instal than k t system did sinc k t tend to be in pretti decent condit it gener isn t necessari to replac it simpli becaus it s k t what you should watch out for is renov that have interf with it and be cautiou about circuit load in mani case it s perfectli reason to leav exist k t alon and add new fixtur on new circuit us modern techniqu after k t thei invent multi conductor cabl the first type you will see is roughli a

thi type of insul embrittl we ve seen whole system where the insul would fractur and fall off at a touch bx cabl of the same vintag ha similar problem thi stuff is veri fragil and becom rather hazard if the wire becom bare thi wire should be left untouch as much as possibl whenev an opportun aris replac it a simpl receptacl or switch replac can turn into a sever hour long frustrat fight with electr tape or heat shrink tube after thi wire techniqu the more modern romex wa invent it s almost a asphalt impregn cloth often a bit sticki thi stuff stand up reason well and doesn t present a
