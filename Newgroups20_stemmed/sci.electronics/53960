subject re decoupl cap onboard i ve us on chip capacitor to reduc ground bounc nois on a small systol arrai chip that had pf load on the clock line design wa in micron n well cmo us the mosi scalabl design rule here ar some thought on the bypass capacitor thei don t help much with simultan output switch there is still a larg induct between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground return so you still get ground and power line bounc thei do help a lot with on chip load as i had with the high load on the clock line the transient you ar try to suppress ar realli high frequenc so forget about larg area of poli thin oxid diff capacitor sinc the rc time constant is too larg what i did is to make a metal metal poli diff sandwich but put a lot of hole in the poli layer allow frequent diff metal contact i forget exactli how wide the poli line were if i were do thi design again i d probabl omit the diff altogeth and us a solid poli sheet instead us just m m and poli and substrat but that ha such a high resist it can be ignor at these speed you ar probabl better off try to tune your circuit to run with slightli slower edg and lower voltag swing especi for output signal than spend chip area on capacitor i had spare space on the die sinc the circuit wa too big for a mosi tini chip and the next size up wa twice as big as i need kevin karplu kevin karplu karplu ce ucsc edu due to budgetari constraint the light at the end of the tunnel is be turn off
