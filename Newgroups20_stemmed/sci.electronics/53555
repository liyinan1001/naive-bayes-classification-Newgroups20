subject re telephon on hook off hok ok circuit in articl apr bnr ca moffatt bnr ca john thomson write just a thought of mine here sinc an on hook line is aprox v and off hook it usual drop below how about an led in seri with a zener sai around v on hook led on off hook led off would thi work if anyon tri tri it pleas let me know ay there s the rub if you draw enough current to light an led the equip at the phone compani will think you ve gone off hook in the on hook state you re not suppos to draw current which mean you should just us your digit voltmet you can us an old vom but the phone compani equip can detect that and might think there s someth wrong with the cabl look gui what s the problem here if you want a light that goe on when the phone is off hook all you need it to run it in seri with the line as i mention in my previou post if you want a light that goe on when the phone is on hook all you need is a voltag threshold detector if you re go to do the seri diod thing which is the easiest just make sure that the led can take the current i can t recal it off hand but it s someth like ma or more care now folk also consid the vac hz that is forc on ring and tip when the phone s suppos to ring even with a simpl zener and led setup you might end up with some carbon real quick whatev scheme you us make sure you ve got at least v rate compon on the frontend also rememb that if i m not mistaken the phone line is a ohm equival circuit ani current you draw from the v or so get drop across that ohm that s fine until you re down to roughli v when ma bell consid it to be off hook but drop it that far down is probabl a big no no the easiest implement to accomplish the abov tip rectifi resistor diod v zener resistor v led ring thi is onli a suggest go ahead and blow hole in it but you get the idea choos a high effici led so you don t need much current to get it to light up choos valu for the other compon as requir aaron
