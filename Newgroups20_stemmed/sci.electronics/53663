subject ground power wire wa re a question about vac outlet wire there ha been quit a bit of discuss about hous wire and ground practic here a few point need to be clarifi the equip ground conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wire method is us as a safeti ground to carri fault current back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltag on the metal case of util equip or other metal object it should never except for a few except to be discuss later carri the normal oper current of a connect load some equip ha filter in the power suppli which mai caus some slight current flow through the ground conductor much commun or audio equip is sensit to nois or slight voltag on the ground conductor and mai requir special wire of the ground conductor to provid reliabl oper orang outlet ar often us for thi with insul ground conductor wire back to the panel box and in mani case back to the servic anyon instal such a system should read both the section on ground in the nation electr code and public on instal quiet isol ground system the code requir the insul ground conductor green wire to run with the current carri conductor back to the panel box and if requir back all the wai to the servic entranc where it is bond to the servic ground water pipe or rod mani of these system ar instal illeg or unsaf where thei do not provid a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the ground conductor of a circuit often call the neutral which is refer to in the code as the identifi conductor and is suppos to be white or natur grei thi conductor is suppos to be connect to ground in most electr system at a singl point gener at the servic entranc panel thi connect is through the main bond jumper in mani household servic panel the main bond jumper is actual a bond screw which attach the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the ground conductor neutral is gener a current carri conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is on of the two conductor complet the circuit from the panel to the load devic sinc the ground conductor neutral is onli connect to the ground conductor bare or green at the servic entranc if the load is ani distanc from the servic and draw ani signific current there will be a small but measur voltag between the ground and ground conductor at the load under normal oper condit if you should incorrectli connect the ground neutral conductor to the ground conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the ground conductor sinc there will now be current flow through the ground conductor it will also no longer be quit at ground potenti at the load end if the load equip ha a metal case which is connect to the ground conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quit at ground potenti the differ under normal non short circuit condit mai be onli a few tenth of a volt but it could also be a volt or two thi normal doe not present a shock hazard howev if you let the metal case of the ground equip come into contact with an independ ground object such as a water or ga pipe a radiat a metal air condit duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through thi aaltern ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a signific arc a low voltag but possibl moder current arc under the wrong condit thi arc could start a fire it is possibl in some case that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequ size caus it to overheat with the incorrect non singl point ground of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which mai flow will caus a much higher voltag on the ground conductor which increas the possibl for shock or fire also if you incorrectli multipli connect the neutral and ground the voltag on the ground system is seen as nois bu comput or audio equip often caus malfunct i have spent some hour track down such short in technic facil where thei were induc sever hum into equip the neutral is usual bond to the ground at the distribut transform as well as at the servic entranc of each dwell thi is done primarili for lightn protect so that induc lightn current have a short path back to ground and also to assur that the current drawn by short to ground object like pipe draw enough current to trip circuit breaker or blow fuse quickli the bad side of thi is that not all the neutral current from the dwell goe through the neutral wire back to the transform some of it flow through the ground electrod water pipe etc thi mai caus corros in the pipe and possibl in thing like underground fuel oil tank and it mai also caus measur ac magnet field due to the larg loop between the hot conductor in the servic and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there ar those who feel these field mai be unhealthi don t flame me on thi i m just tell you where the field come from not it s health effect as far as i m concern the juri is still out on thi note that the bond jumper is onli instal at the main panel not at ani sub distribut panel thi is on reason why it is illeg to run servic entranc cabl with the sheath us as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seper insul conductor for the neutral the sheath can be us in thi applic onli as the ground conductor if the neutral is bond to the ground conductor in the sub panel sai by forget to remov the bond screw all the ground conductor of the load on that panel will be abov ground with the possibl problem list abov the code make except for rang and dryer as well as feed from on build to anoth in the case of the rang and dryer the neutral mai be us as the equip ground under certain condit instead of a seper wire everi time the code is revis these except come up for review these except were in fact the first requir safeti ground in the dai befor u ground outlet and such the applianc manufactur don t want to have to redesign their rang and drier and the contractor don t want to have to run four wire cabl with four fairli heavi expens wire in place of three wire to the applianc no question it would be safer with seper neutral to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner set sinc most current is in the volt hot except at some low set the wire ar larg gaug and there ar few report case of injuri or damag so far the except have surviv in the case of feed between build it s primarili for lightn protect peopl do wire should be awar what is and what isn t a legal ground conductor obvious the bare wire in romex with ground is anywher there is a green wire instal such as in a portabl cord that is a good ground conductor the sheath of bx clamp in bx connector in metal box is a legal ground conductor in the us bx ha an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resist of the sheath you can just cut thi aluminum band off at the end you don t have to bond it to anyth it doe it job by touch everi turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwal tube is gener a legal ground conductor but mai requir a bond locknut where it enter a box or panel particularli for larger pipe greenfield look like big bx but you pull your own wire in the empti sheath after you run it is not a legal ground conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel ha too much resist and induct you have to run a seper green ground conductor insid the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal ground conductor as the paint on the box often prevent good contact and the feed to the wiremold extens is often from a box in the wall that mai not be well connect to the first wiremold box i have person discov case where the entir run of wiremold and the case of everyth plug into all the outlet on the run were hot with volt why do i get a shock everi time i touch my comput and the radiat here in the offic becaus there wa no ground wire in the wiremold and on of the outlet had short to the edg of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlet at least to the first box in the origin wire conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatev on anoth issu while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlet when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to us them without a ground if no ground is avail it is better to have the protect of the ground fault interrupt than no protect if you don t instal it the interrupt doesn t depend on the ground to trip it is desir to connect the ground if avail becaus if the ground is connect the interrupt will trip as soon as a faulti devic is plug in wherea without the ground it will not trip until someon or someth provid a ground path for those question the legal us of unground gcfi s read in the nec d except thi is the code my code is in the citi but i know the rule hasn t chang it might be renumb though we have onli touch the surfac concern ground
