subject re lead acid batteri part in articl apr cronkit oci templ edu camter astro oci templ edu carter am write i thought the first thread wa hilari so here goe anoth post some more background inform on what ha happen to my poor batteri on year i left the batteri in the garag the garag is unheat thei were left in their place that thei need to be on in the ride lawnmow what a lux and on in each motorcycl the batteri in the ride lawnmow wa about year old and on of the cycl batteri wa new and on wa around year old upon spring time i discov that all of the batteri were dead and need to be recharg thei all work properli except for the older on and thei had to be replac about halfwai through the summer thei had origin been store in the garag and i think i rememb my dad charg them in spring last year i decid to bring them in to the basement which ha two part on is dirt and brick and the other is concret i brought in all three and discov in the spring about dai ago that not onli were the batteri dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around in other word it wa pin the intern circut trip and i went on to the other batteri thei were the same realiz that we still had gigant sailboat batteri also lead acid i decid to put the charger on them these had been sit for around and a half year on the brick and dirt part and notic that thei onli need a small charg around hour or so on trickl i test them by us them at the local ga station for give jump start and thei work fine for around of em thi lead me to believ on of sever thing i bought realli tty batteri last year sorta true the concret ha someth to do with the discharg of the batteri there wa enough moistur to short out the termin in the room where the concret is the dirt room wa abl to absorb the moistur in the air better than concret btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room ani other idea could be the alien anyth is possibl the lead acid secondari cell releas energi electr with the follow chemic reaction pb pbo h so pbso h lead and lead iv oxid and sulfur acid produc lead sulfat and water the standard heat of format at c f of the variou compound ar heat of format compound at c kcal mole pb pbo h so pbso h the heat of reaction at c is therefor kcal per mole pbso produc note that lead sulfat is not veri solubl gram per gram water at c and it will thu precipit out of solut where the reaction is occur or the cathod posit termin of the batteri i am almost sure it is the posit termin where the precipit form but i mai be wrong oh well i don t have a corrod batteri to corrob and i don t feel like think through it right now what is import to notic here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exotherm or energi discharg if moistur with dissolv electrolyt acid rain condens on the batteri a conduct path between the termin mai form thi will discharg the batteri as the chemic reaction proce the reaction is revers if electr from an altern or batteri charger is put back into the batteri lead acid batteri must chang in chemic composit to discharg each cell ha all the reactant necessari for the reaction the non react post termin of the lead acid batteri ar there to remov or add electr energi dure a discharg or charg becaus the reaction is exotherm it ha a tendenc to happen though quit slowli under normal circumst so while keep the batteri dry is a good idea it is not a total solut to understand why lead acid batteri do inde discharg faster when store on concret as oppos to wood or earth dirt on should recal lechateli s principl which can be paraphras as anyth subject to some stress will act to move to a more comfort posit here ar the thermal conduct of a some select materi thermal conduct materi temperatur c f btu hr ft ft f ft diatomac earth natur across strata diatomac natur parallel to strata diatomac earth powder densiti lb cu ft concret cinder stone dry pine across grain parallel to grain oak across grain mapl across grain note that the thermal conduct for dirt diatomac earth goe down with temperatur also c is about k and the valu for earth powder ar on the same order of magnitud as natur earth the thermal conduct of concret is around a factor of greater than that of dirt and is time greater than wood it is these differ in thermal conduct that caus the batteri on concret to discharg faster than that on dirt or wood at ani instant the discharg reaction is occur energi is be releas either as electr or heat thermal conduct of air is about btu hr ft ft f ft dure storag except for the trickl that pass through ani condens on the batteri thi energi is mostli releas as heat the higher conduct surfac will remov the heat proportion faster than the lower conduct surfac thu if you perfectli insul a dry batteri on all but the bottom surfac at ani given batteri temperatur abov the storag surfac temperatur the batteri on a concret surfac will be discharg about time faster than that on dirt thi is where lechateli s principl come into plai remov energi from the exotherm reaction will drive the reaction further to complet if the reaction normal occur at room temperatur keep the batteri at that temperatur requir the remov of ani heat produc a concret surfac is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surfac store a batteri in the corner of a pour concret basement and you have surfac remov energi which pull the reaction along also if water evapor from the batteri that elev the ratio of sulfur acid to water thi will tend to drive the discharg reaction jeff white jhwhit ulkyvx louisvil
