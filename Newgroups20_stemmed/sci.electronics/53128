subject hole practic question wa philosoph question in articl sun scri fsu edu jac ds scri fsu edu jim carr write i agre i come at thi from nuclear physic where on often discuss particl hole excit and certain reaction have the effect of appli an annihil oper and creat a hole and it is a subtl question the longer on work with them the more real thei becom there ar also quasi particl which rais the same sort of question about how real the entiti is the phenomenon is most certainli a real on ok i ve ask thi befor and with a new thread on these line i ask thi again if a larg hole current is run thru a resistor will there be i r cool instead of heat can anyon design an amplifi that preferenti amplifi hole current over normal electron current what semiconductor materi have the highest ratio of hole mobil to electron mobil pleas quot actual test sampl rather than estim base on theori also don t be limit to semiconductor consid also insul resistor dielectr piezo electr conductor magnet metal ceram magnetostrict etc note to summar thi thread ha so far state that the onli area where hole ar not detect is the vacuum that is hole particl onli exist in the presenc of matter previou thread have state that hole onli exist in certain semi conductor the question that natur aris is if the hole current insid a semi conductor vanish at the point where the semiconductor is join to a conductor sai copper i don t want a theoret discuss here about whether hole could exist insid metal conductor rather i ask for an experiment discuss on how to amplifi and detect such current if thei exist also note that i have cross post thi to sci electron sinc thi is now becom an electron discuss thanx eric et a forc of natur
