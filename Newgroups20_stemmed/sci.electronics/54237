subject digit ac scale be in the visual stage of a circuit design right now i wa wonder what the best wai to scale an ac voltag us an bit digit word is i am think of us the common method of send the word through an adc and then compar it with the ac voltag convert to a sawtooth wave to get a duti cycl howev i am leari of thi method becaus it a requir a lot of part and more importantli b creat a lot of interfer from the switch on the entir ac line i realiz that correct filter could cancel out most of thi interfer but that would requir more part and boost the price further someon mention to me that thei had seen an ic which input bit of data and directli scale the ac voltag come in all on chip unfortun he couldn t rememb the chip number or the manufactur if anyon els ha heard of thi chip pleas e mail me i am build thi project as a dimmer box for a light control circuit and it is import that the cost of each box remain veri low becaus on dimmer is requir for each light that the user wish to control well each channel at least therefor if each box cost i doubt that an end user will want to dish out x for sixteen channel thi is someth i have notic about todai s dimmer box thei ar so expens anywai ani help which someon could offer on either a method of easili do thi or info about the chip which will do it for me alwai the prefer method will be greatli appreci michael carr m carr onu edu
