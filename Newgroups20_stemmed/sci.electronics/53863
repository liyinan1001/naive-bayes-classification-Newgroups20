subject re digit voltmet how doe it work mamishev alexand valentino avm sigma tamu edu wrote hello let me introduc a problem when i measur a sinusoid wave voltag with a digit voltmet us ac mode my output is an rm valu a peak valu over squar right when i measur a squar wave in the same mode ac my output is equal to a peak valu actual to the upper flat boundari of the wave i assum that a digit voltmet make some kind of integr of the input valu and divid it over the wave period right now i us it to measur the same squar wave as abov but distort by high frequenc harmon ideal output should be the same but the output valu wa onli about of the previou on why what is the natur of thi output valu what doe the voltmet actual measur and what doe it show re rm read unless the dvm sai it s measur rm it s probabl averag voltag the input is diod rectifi and measur as dc if it sai it s rm and but measur squar triangl etc incorrectli it s measur averag and multipl by a correct that s onli true for sine wave i e vave vrm if you want correct rm for most ani waveform you need a true rm dvm dmm which liter doe the root mean squar calcul in either analog or digit circuitri relat question less import to me what ar advantag and disadvantag of digit voltmet to compar with analog on the last signific advantag of analog imo wa be abl to see the signal if it wa chang over time e g check electrolyt capacitor anymor most dmm have bargraph etc that duplic thi thank you for your attent you could mail me your opinion at avm zeu tamu edu or open a discuss here i would appreci either wai alexand v mamishev power system autom laboratori phone offic depart of electr engin phone home texa a m univers fax colleg station tx usa internet avm zeu tamu edu jeff gruszynski semiconductor test equip system engin hewlett packard or t jeff hpmvd nsr hp com jeff hpuplca nsr hp com
