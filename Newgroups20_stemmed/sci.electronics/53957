subject voltag regul and current limit on not so quick question to throw out there for you gui for our class project we need to design and build a power suppli to the follow spec voltatg adjust from v current limit at a voltag must stai within of design valu for i from a ac rippl less than mv rm of cours we can t just us an adjust voltag current limit regul chip our problem is with the current limit i e we ve found stuff to do the rest of the part of the circuit what the suppli must do if present with a load which would draw more than a given the suppli voltag is reduc the voltag so that the current will equal on amp thu if we were to short the thing with the ammet we should read on amp if we measur the current through a ohm resistor at v we should read on amp and the output voltag by necess must be v the onli basic idea we have seen for the current limit involv a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefor reduc the output so doe anybodi have ani idea we could work from thank in advanc andi collin kc yei acollin uclink berkelei edu ps if anybodi want to flame thi as a stupid project i agre fulli but i still have to do it it grade
