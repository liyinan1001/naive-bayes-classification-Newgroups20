subject optoisol interfac question i am interfac some simpl circuit that run on v to my cpu board which run at v the optoisol is a n on the led side i put the signal i want through a k resistor to the base of a n on the transistor side i tie my cpu input line to the collector which ha a pull up resistor of k it function ok but seem veri slow i can detect puls that occur at about khz but not much faster isn t the rise fall time of thi devic someth like us i should be abl to detect my target of khz but i can t get khz thi is done us wire wrap and the wire go to the cpu and to the test pin ar about inch long but i m not do anyth high speed in the art of electron it mention ty the base of the phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improv the speed is that what i need to do how do i calcul the resistor valu paul malenf pmalenfa kitkat webo dg com
