subject re voltag regul and current limit andi collin acollin uclink berkelei edu wrote on not so quick question to throw out there for you gui for our class project we need to design and build a power suppli to the follow spec voltatg adjust from v current limit at a voltag must stai within of design valu for i from a ac rippl less than mv rm to decid which kind of circuit you must know the initialpreciss of the limit current and the allow temp drift in the first case you can us a ub of a transistor as a voltag refer of about vdc with a temp drift of mv k in the second case it better you us a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum current the output of thi opamp control the outputstag to limit the current bye thoma
