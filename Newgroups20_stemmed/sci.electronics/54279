subject re lead acid batteri part the lead acid secondari cell releas energi electr with the follow chemic reaction pb pbo h so pbso h lead and lead iv oxid and sulfur acid produc lead sulfat and water heat of format delet the heat of reaction at c is therefor kcal per mole pbso produc note that lead sulfat is not veri solubl gram per gram water at c and it will thu precipit out of solut where the reaction is occur or the cathod posit termin of the batteri i am almost sure it is the posit termin where the precipit form but i mai be wrong oh well i don t have a corrod batteri to corrob and i don t feel like think through it right now the major problem with thi is that the reaction take place in an acid solut pbso is solubl in an acid solut and will not precipit out also h so is in a water solut as h and so thu the heat of format of pbso and h so ar for the most part irrelev what is import to notic here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exotherm or energi discharg as it turn out the reaction is inde exotherm heat produc more about thi later what actual happen to make the batteri complet useless is thi we re talk lead acid batteri of cours the batteri slowli self discharg as thi discharg take place two thing happen the level of pb ion in the acid solut increas i e the lead and lead oxid plate ar dissolv the level of h ion in the acid solut decreas i e the solut becom less acid or more like water if you like now as the post to which i am respond correctli state pbso will precipit in a water non acid solut when the batteri di i e is fulli discharg we end up with a high concentr of pb and so in water so pbso form in the solut and fall to the bottom of the batteri of cours thi happen in vari degre the more discharg the more precipit form the precipit form a conduct layer on the bottom of the batteri if there is enough of the lead and lead oxid plate left to touch the precipit more common in a newer batteri a dead short result i have seen product in automot shop to correct thi condit but thei ar for the most part useless thei can dissolv the pbso but cannot restor the lead and lead oxid plate properli you mai have some success with these product for a newer batteri stuff delet to understand why lead acid batteri do inde discharg faster when store on concret as oppos to wood or earth dirt on should recal lechateli s principl which can be paraphras as anyth subject to some stress will act to move to a more comfort posit here ar the thermal conduct of a some select materi stuff delet thi is where lechateli s principl come into plai remov energi from the exotherm reaction will drive the reaction further to complet if the reaction normal occur at room temperatur keep the batteri at that temperatur requir the remov of ani heat produc a concret surfac is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surfac store a batteri in the corner of a pour concret basement and you have surfac remov energi which pull the reaction along thi stuff is just made up by the author and is complet invalid in fact the discharg reaction take place at a higher rate at higher temperatur a logic consequ of the abov argument is thi if you realli want your car to start lower the batteri temperatur to to pull the reaction along we all know from experi at least those of us in canada do it get cold up here that thi is not true if we want to start our car on a realli cold dai we warm the batteri besid which there is not enough energi releas through self discharg to appreci rais the temperatur the air would ampli dissip ani such heat whether the bottom of the batteri wa insul or not thi is of cours irrelev sinc you would want the batteri to be cool dure storag just keep the batteri in a cool dry place and keep it charg
