subject voltag multipli problem hi i ve just built a valv preamp and us a diod capacitor voltag multipli to step the vac suppli voltag up to approx vdv as the load resist increas the rc constant decreas and henc the output voltag drop i need as high an output voltag as possibl about v the circuit consist of seven voltag multipli stage ie diod and capacitor each capacitor develop about v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitor v each capacitor is mfd at v if i increas each of the capacitor rate mfd that will increas the rc constant and henc allevi some of the problem these capacitor ar go to be a littl expens as i need of them so what would happen if i connect a mfd at v capacitor in parallel with the output and henc in parallel with the seven mfd capacitor will it as i assum increas the c in circuit and henc increas the rc time constant if it doe and my output voltag becom more stabl by do thi then i will have kill two bird with on stone as i am experienc some hz rippl and henc amp hum and thi new capacitor will smooth thi out and can anyon recomend a suitabl valu for an inductor choke to be place in the output line of the power suppli to filter out the hz main hum lowest resist possibl i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment becaus it is too much of a distract i m at univers and i ve got to get my dissert finish in two week henc i m mail not plai with my soldero iron it ll be cheaper too in the long run especi if new larg capacitor don t work as plan email pleas can t alwai read the net thank in advanc chri name mr chri smith twang on that ol guitar addr scst uk ac liv csc uni liverpool univers quest to build more and more hardwar dgree comput scienc what ever the sun mai be it is certainli not a ball of flame ga d h lawrenc all view express ar my own and reflect that of privat thought
