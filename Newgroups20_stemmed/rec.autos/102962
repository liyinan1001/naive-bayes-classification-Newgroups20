normal read thi group i wa look for valentin radar inform sigh mayb in the faq and came across your post i bought a probe gt with the pep a last juli now at mile after debat over the sentra se r nx mx mr stealth prelud and celica check thi month s consum report for previou probe record my criteria a fun car with ab airbag over hp and less than k i thought about a turbo but check with insur peopl rule that out the tri star car eclips talon etc were out sinc thei don t have an air bag ditto for the mustang also no ab the se r nx m fell into the pocket rocket categori a good us car bui the mx wa almost there but roll more than i like i didn t like the prelud dash instrument at all too weird for me the mr ha a much smaller non passeng space than i need so out that went the celica wa ok but underpow when load with option and somewhat overpr too in non turbo form i never consid the sx sinc it didn t have an airbag i did look at it for it rwd virtu but that s it the corolla never enter my mind i should have look at the mitsubishi vr dodg stealth more sinc my list wa exhaust i bought the probe the car design is differ than earlier year so it s too earli to see it reliabl so far for what it s worth my comment my dislik shut door with window up from insid rare make good wind seal headlight have stuck up a few time weather air condit broke mile pressur cycl switch condens around rear washer fluid contain doesn t drain complet cram engin littl hope for do it yourself typic part somewhat more expens than normal ford part undersid plastic doesn t like sharp drivewai and speedbump typic assembl gripe tape on radiat screw fell out of dash seat seam not stitch properli hopefulli just a fluke ford onli give kei with the car c mon ford spend an extra few penni rear hatch ha no pad on corner when up i m wait for the dai when i bash my head on the corner horn button behind air bag in spoke and not in center person prefer tire fling dirt mud onto side of car my like engin design valv sound smooth power mileag torqu definit handl veri good for fwd underst onli at limit transmiss the speed is a must usabl instrument love readabl analog everywher veri littl torqu steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stabil at mph high gear though low cowl good visibl in front heat outsid mirror nice in fog never test in freez weather ab air bag see abov rear seat fold down i have few rear seat passeng so a trunk not import no shake rattl nois when go over bump pothol still tire vr goodyear eagl left hope for k as you can see i m primarili interest in the engin while it doesn t have the uummmph of a big liter car or the turbo rush the big sell point for me wa the all aluminum valu liter engin the overal car is a good bui for the monei that market segment hasn t chang much sinc juli prelud vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each dai on rel smooth road and most notic thing is that the probe s suspens doesn t like pothol when you test drive on find a pothol road somewher around town and see if the jar you get is toler if you have passeng by all mean bring them along too thei ll find that thei have no room in the back and you ll find that the car ride differ if that s better is up to you also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expect the temperatur insid the car get pretti hot in the summer my back seat passeng now veri few complain about the lack of ventil you mai want to consid that when combin with the heat i ve heard that the exhaust system ha troubl but mine work fine leather and the keyless entri system weren t avail when i got the car so i can t comment on them i got the car befor it wa offici announc i prefer cloth to leather anywai i wouldn t want thi car in the snow the suspens is too rough for the inevit surpris pothol tire aren t meant for snow and the seat assum that you re not wear lot of thick cloth rain is much better water gener bead off the windshield at freewai speed the windshield wiper control ar easi and understand and i bare hydroplan onc with the eagl and i wa realli try there is also a definit lack of cup holder small storag place the gt ha map holder below the speaker in the door but thei re rigid plastic that could fit two cassett or cd s max the center consol storag bin arm rest ha cup holder and the back of the front seat have a cloth pouch but that s it no chang holder quit a let down from the sho and the probe is definit not a peopl mover car or an econo box car lastli don t store wet car cover in the back the foam will soak the water up and the result will
