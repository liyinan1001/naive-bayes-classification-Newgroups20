sinc the credit card kei doesn t have ani teeth cut in it yet i guess i won t count it rear hatch ha no pad on corner when up i m wait for the dai when i bash my head on the corner horn button behind air bag in spoke and not in center person prefer the latter is probabl becaus of the air bag it s pretti much take up all the space where you d expect to find the horn speak of the horn i wa surpris to find that the probe come with on of those nice merican sound horn instead of the japanes sound kind the previou probe had japanes horn tire fling dirt mud onto side of car yeah not veri badli but enough to be annoi sometim my like engin design valv sound smooth power mileag torqu definit handl veri good for fwd underst onli at limit transmiss the speed is a must usabl instrument love readabl analog everywher veri littl torqu steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stabil at mph high gear though low cowl good visibl in front heat outsid mirror nice in fog never test in freez weather ab air bag see abov rear seat fold down i have few rear seat passeng so a trunk not import no shake rattl nois when go over bump pothol still tire vr goodyear eagl left hope for k i agre strongli with all of the abov especi about the engin the interior is veri veri nice too veri pleas to the ey and ergonom sound i drive it to and from work each dai on rel smooth road and most notic thing is that the probe s suspens doesn t like pothol when you test drive on find a pothol road somewher around town and see if the jar you get is toler ye thi car s stiff suspens isn t for everyon i person like it but if you find it a littl harsh but otherwis like the car i d strongli suggest look into the mx if you have passeng by all mean bring them along too thei ll find that thei have no room in the back and you ll find that the car ride differ if that s better is up to you the problem with the back seat is that there s no leg room plenti of head room though shorter peopl fit back there without ani complaint so long as the seat thei ar sit behind is pull forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expect the temperatur insid the car get pretti hot in the summer my back seat passeng now veri few complain about the lack of ventil you mai want to consid that when combin with the heat the power moonroof can greatli improv the ventil throughout the car i realli enjoi the moonroof by the wai but then i ve alwai been a sucker for open air drive no leakag problem or anyth like that yet i ve heard that the exhaust system ha troubl but mine work fine i haven t heard about thi on i know that some of the veri earli probe and mayb had problem with prematur rust muffler which ford will replac at no charg but i haven t heard about anyth like thi concern the probe i haven t had ani real troubl with thi car outsid of a cv joint boot that wa leak but the dealer took care of that promptli and even gave me a free rental car for the dai and a half that i wa without my car i wa quit happi with the wai thei handl especi consid that i wa expect the worst from them from what i ve heard it sound like ford mazda had some qc problem with the probe and probabl mx when thei first went into product but i think these problem have mostli been correct at thi point that s almost alwai to be expect with a complet new car
