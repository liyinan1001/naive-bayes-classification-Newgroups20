subject rec auto frequent ask question archiv name rec auto part thi articl is on of a pair of articl contain commonli ask automot question the other articl contain question of gener consum interest and is broken out to facilit crosspost to misc consum rpw last chang februari ct now permit radar detector usag new tire traction q a rpw commonli ask question radar question q where ar radar detector illeg a in the us current virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usag of radar detector new york prohibit their us in larg truck in canada thei ar illeg in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei princ edward island thei ar appar ar illeg through most if not all of europ legisl which would make them illeg is pend in mani other jurisdict chanc of such legisl pass vari a great deal q where ar radar detector detector us do thei realli work a usag is spread rapidli initi thei were us onli in canada but now thei ar appear in new york and virginia it is unsaf to assum that thei ar not in us in connecticut and d c thei work by detect a certain frequenc radiat by mani current avail super het radar detector some brand of detector radiat more strongli than other and ar thu more like to be spot new radar detector ar becom avail which mai not be detect by the current gener of detector detector note that a detector mai onli be spot by on of these devic if it is turn on q what is vascar is it some kind of radar a vascar is noth more than a fanci stopwatch and time speed distanc comput it depend on the oper press button as the target vehicl pass landmark no radar signal ar emit by a vascar system q what is ka band radar where is it us should a radar detector be abl to handl it a ka band ha recent been made avail by the fcc for us in the us in so call photo radar instal in these instal a low power beam is aim across the road at a degre angl to the direct of traffic and a pictur is taken of vehicl which the radar unit determin to have been in violat of the speed limit ticket ar mail to the owner of the vehicl becaus of the low power and the degre angl mani peopl believ that a radar detector cannot give reason warn of a ka band radar unit although some manufactur of radar detector have ad such capabl anywai the number of local where photo radar is in us is limit and some question the legal of such unit best advic learn what photo radar unit look like and keep track of where thei ar us or els don t speed q do radar jammer work ar thei legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detail answer cheap radar jammer do not work well at all jammer that work ar expens and usual the properti of the militari jammer ar a major violat of the regul of the feder commun commiss of the usa drive techniqu and vehicl dynam question q what ar underst and overst a underst and overst ar term describ the behaviour of a car while corner near the limit limit of adhes that is most driver do not normal drive hard enough for these term to be descript of the situat thei encount simpli put thei tell whether the car want to go straight in a corner steer less or underst or it want to turn more in a corner overst underst is commonli design into most product car so that untrain driver inadvertantli travel too fast won t get into troubl underst mai also be induc by us too much throttl in a corner overst is design into some more perform orient car it mai be induc by lift on the throttl trail throttl overst or tto in extrem case lift on the throttl mai induc so much overst that the car react by fishtail or spin some technic detail in a corner at speed the tire on the car will develop what ar call slip angl the slip angl is the angular differ between the direct that the car is travel and the direct that the steer wheel is direct the car to travel in underst the front wheel have a greater slip angl than the rear wheel in overst the rear wheel have a greater slip angl than the front wheel q what is a rev match downshift a when downshift the engin must be rotat faster in the lower gear than it wa in the higher gear howev dure a downshift normal you declutch and lift your foot from the throttl so the rev drop rather than increas in rev match downshift you blip the throttl befor re engag the clutch so that the engin will alreadi be up to the new speed thi result in a much smoother and faster downshift q what doe heel and toe mean a heel and toe is a techniqu us to do a rev match downshift while brake thi is normal challeng becaus you need the right foot for both the brake and throttl it is call heel and toe becaus you us on end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttl to match rev for the downshift in mani modern car thi is a misnom often you must us the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttl note that some race car driver will skip the clutch and just us the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttl accomplish the same thing q what is doubl clutch downshift a while your right foot is do the abov your left foot can do on of three thing noth declutch onc or declutch twice the reason for declutch twice is to match the speed of the two shaft in the transmiss to the speed of the engin thi is usual coupl with rev match so that while the engin is in neutral and the clutch engag the throttl is blip and both shaft of the transmiss speed up the procedur is as follow declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engag clutch match rev declutch move gearshift lever to next lower gear engag clutch thi sound like a lot of work but with practic it becom natur the problem that doubl clutch solv is normal the function of the synchron within the gearbox in transmiss without synchro or with veri worn synchro doubl clutch make it much easier to shift basic if you doubl clutch well you ar not us the synchro at all thi is gener unnecessari on street car with synchro in good condit q what do the number for acceler from mile skidpad and slalom time in the auto magazin realli mean mai thei be compar a in short not as much as the magazin want you to believ and almost never in more detail the acceler number mph and mile time in the us mai be vagu compar as long as thei all come from the same sourc test procedur vari so much from magazin to magazin that compar a road track number to a car driver number is quit pointless keep in mind too that the same variat appli from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equat skidpad vari and even if thei didn t skidpad figur ar realli onli test of the sticki of the stock tire thei chang radic when tire compound chang do not make ani assumpt about the compar handl of sai two sport sedan base on skidpad number thi is not to suggest that skidpad ar without valu howev skidpad ar an excel educ tool at drive school thei ar simpli of limit valu in the comparison of anyth except tire slalom time ar slightli more us thei test some small part of the automobil s transient respons howev thei ar also heavili influenc by the stock rubber on the car and thei do not test mani corner of the car s envelop thei do not tell you all you need to know befor make a bui decis for exampl thei don t tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenli goe off camber when a car ha an adjust suspens these test ar usual done in the sport set which mai be quit unsuit for daili drive the list of caveat could go on for page after page q my buddi claim that wide tire don t make ani differ accord to hi freshman physic textbook and that you can t ever acceler or corner at more than g doe he know what he s talk about a in short he hasn t got a clue in more detail the equat for friction us in freshman physic textbook presum that the surfac ar smooth dry and non deform none of which properli appli to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below it proper oper temperatur pavement is never smooth it is alwai irregular to a greater or lesser extent tire which ar not realli dry and solid as rubber is a substanc which in it natur form is liquid and which ha onli been coerc into a semblanc of solid by chemic magic deform to match the surfac of the pavement which a vehicl is travel over in a tire at oper temperatur grip is actual gener by shear stress insid the deform rubber and not by anyth even remot resembl friction in the freshman physic sens of the term the colder a tire is rel to it oper temperatur the closer it behaviour will be to the tradit concept of friction if much hotter than the it proper oper temperatur the more like the possibl of some part of the tire actual revert to liquid which is mostli like to happen deep in the tread caus characterist blister and chunk thi latter though is almost complet unlik to happen in normal street drive so unless you re a competit driver or do a lot of high speed track drive don t worri about it becaus tire traction is complet out of the domain of simpl friction it doe not obei the freshman physic equat at all thu dragster acceler at more than g and race car corner and brake at more than g becaus simpl friction doe not appli it is actual possibl for differ size contact patch to gener differ amount of grip an actual analysi of tire behavior would requir techniqu such as finit element analysi due to the complex of the mechan misc question q what doe name or acronym stand for a here is a list of some of the name which ar commonli ask about be care in solicit the mean of other name as misinform abound on the net in particular
