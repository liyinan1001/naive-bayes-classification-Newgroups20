subject re best radar detector valentin in articl apr sequent com troi sequent com troi wecker write let me explain why i feel the bogei counter featur is a gimmick radar wave bounc off object especi metal that is how radar speed measur work a high frequenc microwav x band approx ghz and k is approx ghz is sent out and reflect back to the antenna off of an automobil or other object if an object is move a doppler shift about hz per mph on x band occur is measur and convert to mile per hour these wave bounc all over the place and thei can reflect mani time and go in mani direct from what i understand the valentin can onli tell if these microwav ar come from the front rear or both there ar onli two antenna if thei ar come from both thi in interpret as a side bogei bogei count ar determin as sourc by their rel strength to on anoth even if thei ar reflect of the same sourc i m certainli no engin and realli have no scientif basi on which to make thi argument but don t you answer your own question is the reflect signal shift at all from the act of be reflect if so wouldn t it then be easi for the detector to discrimin between reflect and direct sourc here is the problem sinc the microwav reflect how doe the unit tell if it is a sourc or a reflect take a valentin and drive to the local groceri store that us an x band radar door open you can tell by the small black box abov the door point down at about a degre angl and your detector go off when it get near the valentin will count or bogei from all direct front rear and side it doesn t sai which side the count chang as car drive by and reflect chang is there or sourc not at the store i go to as i drive around with a standard detector i can onli find on sourc and that is the door open for the front door troi wecker troi sequent com sequent comput system beaverton or david w hwang m d david ganglion ann arbor mi us
