subject review audi s quattro it s been a while sinc i ve review a car but todai i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audi ha been so overwhelm that he make a not too sucess live sell them without further delai i will get to the audi s servotron steer for those who ar not familiar with what servotron is it is the name for the speed variabl power steer manufactur by zf and us in audi and bmw i have been outspoken in my dam of servotron over the past coupl of month and thi wa base on magazin review and drive of the audi cs quattro and the audi cs fwd i am quit happi to report now that on the s the servotron is inoffens i suppos that due to the fat gumbal tire the servotron ha been load up more and thi so far ha been the best implement that i have tri it is far from perfect mind you and i d be much happier if it wa an option that i could refus but on the s i no longer consid thi to be bad enough where i feel the entir car is ruin the steer is still a tad too light but it is accur and i suppos the stiffli sprung chassi send back so much inform that some make it through to the driver s hand so there is feel and there is accuraci in the s s steer but there is also room for improv i consid the s s steer to be better than the japanes competit primarili becaus the japanes do not believ in feel and engin it out complet engin wheee what a pressur cooker with just mile on the clock i did not expect the s to be produc anywher close to what it will be put out mile later but still the car pack a terrif punch for a turbocharg machin it is veri unusu in that it encourag lazi drive i e low rev high gear it is so suprem flexibl that on could hardli believ that there s onli liter of displac to move thi pound car around in such a fashion with maximum torqu avail at rpm and a rpm redlin the car can pretti much be left in third all dai which translat to a speed rang of someth like mph a chracterist that on normal associ with larg capac v s the technic achiev is breadthtak throttl respons is right up there with a good atmospher engin in fact it would even put peaki multivalv engin to shame downshift ar almost unnecessari it is more fun to us the overboost featur than to rev the engin for those not familiar the s engin featur up to second of addit turbo boost for pass sort of like light up the after burner in a jet fighter on could with the right foot onli in third gear blast the car from to in just a few moment simpli by floor the ga as far as the number go maximum torqu avail in overboost mode shoot up to about lb ft incred for a liter it take a few moment for it to develop overboost but it is well worth wait for sinc thi is quit a heavi car on s bodi part ar not flung around like sai the corrado vr the acceler is smooth and strong somewhat similar to ride in a jetlin as it acceler down the runwai on takeoff also on is treat to a veri distinct and entertain whistl from the turbo the onli entertain sound to come out of a veri refin but bland sound banger ye audi ha refin the to the point where at rpm it sound as seren as it doe at the smooth is outstand but not quit up to the standard of a veri good e g a valv bmw i d sai that in term of refin i e willing to rev smooth lack of harsh under full acceler it is better than mani v s howev lost in the refin process is the characterist cylind bark that made the older engin so charact if not terribl refin the valv turbo sound pretti bland except for the whistl under full boost subject i d rate the vw vr engin as be far more music than the turbo also audi s own v is also far more music with a rorti race car growl when press though none of these can match it grunt the onli hint of the engin s true capac occur when on is take off from rest after the turbo ha come to a near stop with the extra inertia from the perman engag wd system on ha to be somewhat delic in feed in the clutch to prevent an embarass stall altern on could us more rev in both case a veri small price to pai for such a fantast engin i think that audi of america should offer an automat option for thi car just as thei offer though in extrem small number a speed for the much peakier v the characterist of the engin ar perfect for an automat iron in europ a slush is avail but none is offer for the land of the slush market twit rear their ugli head again chassi i ve notic that audi tend to have veri wide wheel and rel modest tire width the car come with fireston of size zr which is not uncommon at all howev the veri attract spoke wheel ar no less than inch wide so there is no sidewal bulg whatsoev combin with the flare wheel arch the s ha a mouth water macho yet subdu look on rough concret it becom immedi clear that the new bodi style ha made signific advanc in structur rigid as well as road nois suppress i suppos the two ar inter relat but i digress to us a clich the s s bodi feel like it ha been carv out of stone flex is total undetect even when go over rough road with a super rigid bodi like thi stiff spring and stiff damper do not caus excess harsh and while the s s ride qualiti will never worri a lexu it will also not draw comparison to truck or poni car the servotron steer ha alreadi been mention i consid it to be inoffens becaus it did not inhibit spirit corner i wa abl to test the car s corner power without too much trepid i think a new concept is at work in thi car with it fat gumbal tire talk about underst or overst is practic meaningless on a bank highwai on ramp i went in slow and start appli power as i went around i could feel the g forc build to the point where the skin on my face wa be tug sidewai yet the car wa total and complet obedi to throttl and steer input it felt that the limit were not even close to be approach the g forc were thrill but the entir affair of go around a curv is strang uninvolv you tell the car what you want and it doe it end of stori i think that i am start to relat more and more to those review who were highli impress by the honda nsx s clinic effici but were unabl to fall in love with the car the brake have a veri good firm to them and stop the car pretti well too though i ve read that thei ar prone to fade i am not too surpris sinc the s doe not have uprat brake over the base audi fwd harder pad would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden respons when cold i am start to see a trend among the luxuri sport sedan maker where extra weight is not be offset by addit brake capac the ls s fade perform is noth to brag about neither is the q s or the legend s brake fade these dai seem to be a forgotten virtu when everybodi s attent is focus on anti lock capabl comfort for a car with such sporti abil it comfort level ar also excel the cabin is beautifulli appoint with carbon fiber panel insert in place of the wood trim of the s all the expect gizmo ar there heat seat power seat seat memori power thi and that the glare ommis wa the trip comput which wa remov becaus audi hasn t gotten it to work reliabl yet that mean that the car ha no boost gaug a real disappoint take into account how much the turbo domin it perform unusu for the german the s come with a honda style moonroof as well as the veri intellig dial a sunroof posit rotari switch nois level includ engin and tire nois is so low that i wouldn t consid the lexu advantag in thi area to be signific enough to swai a potenti buyer conclus even though few will be abl to afford an audi s at it sticker price of k the car is a bargain if on take into account what it ha to offer over the competit the valv turbo is a real gem even if it doesn t produc ferrari sound no other luxuri sport sedan maker offer the utter secur of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra monei all by itself the safeti featur ar also top notch side impact standard compliant the veri eleg automat seat belt tension and the dual airbag the seri audi have been outstand in govern crash test it get my thumb up for be so overwhelmingli capabl rather than be all out excit and intox eliot
