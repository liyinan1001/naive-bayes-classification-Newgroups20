subject vitamin a and infect i ve sent gordon r my post on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior to post on internet as a profession courtesi somehow i ve manag to delet my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r had promis to send it back to me but he s pretti mad at me right now so i ll just retyp it sinc dig through all my refer is veri time consum took me all dai for that pm post i m not go to cite ani refer gordon r ha them i m go to includ some of the materi from weinsier and morgan s new nutrit textbook which wa not in my origin materi to point out that what i m go to sai ha some support in the medic commun diet ha been know to affect the immun system of man for a veri veri long time protein ha alwai had the biggest role in infect and i ve alreadi cover the role of protein in protect you against infect now i m go to hit what i consid to be the most import nutrient in the u s as far as infect is concern vitamin a when vitamin a wa origin discov it wa commonli refer to as the anti infect vitamin mani peopl linu paul be on have decid to take thi titl awai from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i ve alreadi cover big mistak in my opinion vitamin a is also get a reput as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci current ha numer clinic trial in progress to see if vitamin a can not onli prevent cancer but cure it as well it s role in both cancer and infect is almost ident but not quit vitamin a come in two complet differ form retinol and beta caroten retinol is the anim form and it s toxic beta caroten is the plant form and it s complet nontox both retinol and beta caroten displai good absorpt in the human gut if bile is present the liver store all of your retinol and dole it out for other tissu to us by synthes retinol bind protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have iu to iu of retinol store we ar born with iu in our liver u s autopsi ha shown that about of american die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as thei were born with if you don t believ that nutrit reserv like that of retinol in the liver ar import then thi low vitamin a reserv is not go to affect you but if you believ like i do that the nutrient reserv ar import then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u s the u s rda for vitamin a in an adult male is re or iu of vitamin a for adult feaml it re or iu of vitamin a diet survei show that most american ar get thi amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta caroten from their diet but the nrc nation research council wa go to releas a new rda tabl in that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c rais c to mg per dai and a to iu per dai for adult male that report and it s recommend wa kill why concern over the increas supplement wa the main reason rda ar set to prevent clinic diseas not to keep nutrient reserv full mani scientist in the u s feel that the time ha come to move awai from the prevent of clinic patholog concept and move toward the promot of optimum health concept especi sinc we have some veri good data now that show that nutrient reserv ar extrem import dure period of stress the nutriton concerv won that battl and a new group of scientist were collect to come out with the rda list which lower the rda for sever nutrient and move the dietari guidelin back to where thei were when we first start in the s get enough to prevent clinic patholog but not enough to fill the reserv we know from autopsi that onli about of american have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserv iu to iu i preach nutrient reserv to my student and tell them to measur them in their patient but for vitamin a onli a liver biopsi or autopsi data will tell you how much somebodi ha store we can tell veri easili if someon ha overfil hi or her liver with vitamin a by measur the serium retinol level level abov ug dl ar highli suggest that you have fill your liver with vitamin a and it s time to stop take retinol the normal rang of serum retinol will be ug dl hypervitaminosi a is diagnos with a serum retinol level of ug dl or higher interpret of diagnost test wallach m d a littl brown seri book thi level of vitamin a in blood mean that medic attent is necessari due to vitamin a toxic weinsier and morgan take a much more conserv approach to vitamin a toxic than doe wallach as you will see later in thi post between ug dl and ug dl you should have plenti of warn that it s time to elimin the retinol from your diet headach red of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my student that will us vitamin a in their practic that thei had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there ar clear sign that the liver is full you will never realli know if the patient need the vitamin a becaus you can not measur the pool in liver but you will alwai know when it s time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pm studi beta caroten can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worri about toxic becaus the convers of beta caroten to retinol that occur in both your gut and your liver will slow down stop in the liver and slow down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol but take beta caroten as the sourc of retinol take a veri long time to fill the liver up i ve seen estim of year if you ar in the that onli ha as much as you were born with in your liver iu on other problem with beta caroten if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta caroten to retinol in the gut or the liver becaus the enxzym that doe thi convers requir zinc in addit the releas of retinol from the liver is a zinc depend process so a zinc deficit will caus a vitamin a deficit even if your liver ha plenti of vitamin a now what doe vitamin a do in cancer and infect protect the bodi us vitamin a retinol for mani differ thing vision the first to be nail down and where you see overt clinic patholog us the aldehyd retin and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduct us the retinol form and some retin infect and cancer protect us retino acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cell and the mucos cell get from blood to retino acid you us enzym on of which requir vitamin c thi is why paul ha tri to pull the titl of anti infect vitamin awai from vitamin a vitamin c doe plai a role in infect interferon product for exampl but it s biggest role is the convers of retinol to retino acid if you increas your intak of vitamin c you will increas your format of retino acid but retino acid can not be convert back to retinol as retin can and onc it s form it s us and then lost to the bodi thi is why the nrc group want to increas both vitamin c and vitamin a rda s most peopl take larg amount of vitamin c realli think that thei ar help themselv if thei don t have much vitamin a in their liver and thei ar not also increas their intak of vitamin a thei actual do themselv more harm than good retino acid function in white blood cell to promot antibodi format in the mucu membran it is the main factor in promot good mucu product and a good epitheli cell barrier to prevent infecti agent from enter the blood system the mucu membran is refer to as the first line defens against infect for cancer retino acid ha been shown to act as a cell brake it counteract the effect of cell promot which stimul cell to divid cancer ha two distinct step dna alter and cell promot for cell that normal divid all the time promot ar not that import but for lung and breast tissu which doe not normal divid promot ar real import in the malign process thi is the major reason why the nci ha so mani differ clinic trial in progress us retinol and or beta caroten chronic infect irrit of the mucu membran is a signal that vitamin a mai not be adequ i tell my student that ani patient who walk into their offic with a complaint of chronic infect ha to be work up for vitamin a along with the other factor that medicin alreadi ha on it s list of caus for chronic infect i drive thi home in my cours at the osteopath colleg in tulsa when i teach at the allopath medic school in tulsa ou s branch campu and when i give cme lectur dark adapt is the best clinic test for vitamin a statu sinc night vision is impact when liver reverv drop to iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be us but it doe not drop until liver reserv drop below to iu ask a patient if thei have troubl see at night is a good initi screen if cataract ar rule out in on studi done on u s spanish american where serum retinol level were measur of the sampl popul had a serum retinol level below ug dl as more studi ar done on serum retinol level in popul group of the u s that have had a histori of high infect rate we will probabl see a much stonger correl between infect incid rate and low serum retinol level what do weinsier and morgan have to sai about vitamin a here ar excerpt from their book vitamin a function in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessai for growth and different of epitheli tissu and is requir for reproduct embryon develop and bone growth protein calori malnutrit and zinc defici mai impair the absorpt transport and metabol of vitamin a retinaldehyd is convert to retino acid which ha biolog activ in growth and in cell diferenti but not in reproduct or vision the most common procedur to evalu vitamin a statu is to measur the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal rang for vitamin a content for a child is to ug dl lower valu ar indic of defici or deplet bodi store serum level greater than ug dl ar indic of toxic level of vitamin a dark adapt test and electroretinogram measur ar also us but difficult to perform on young children rapidli prolifer tissu ar sensit to vitamin a defici and mai revert to an undifferenti state the bronchorespiratori tract skin genitourinari system gastrointestin tract and sweat gland ar advers affect a daili intak of more than mg about iu of retinol is not advis and chronic us of amount over mg iu can result in a dry and itch skin desquam erythemat dermat hair loss joint pain chap lip hyperostoi boni depos headach anorexia edema and fatigu thei recommend mg of retinol via im inject in children for vitamin a defici but do not discuss treatment for adult their toxic serum retinol level is veri conserv i recommend that my student try iu in adult that ar have problem with chronic infect thei have to rule out a zinc deficit first by get an rbc zinc run or if their clinic lab can t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at iu per dai toxic should not be a problem and you will not have to worri about pull the patient into the offic on a regular basi to run a serum retinol both elain and jon found doctor who us a much higher dose of vitamin a recal that the pm paper were us iu to iu of vitamin a i don t suggest that my student us these high dose if you want to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinic trial and were monitor the serum retinol level then you would be okai but my knowledg of the vitamin a literatur suggest to me that iu for patient with a demonstr vitamin a deficit dark adapat test or serum retinol will provid a good and steadi improv as long as zinc and vitamin c statu ar good without have to worri about toxic if thei want to get more agress fine if thei follow my advis to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could becom pregnant sinc vitamin a show teratogen toward the human fetu the dose need to show thi effect on the develop fetu is iu of retinol per dai beta caroten will never have thi effect on the human fetu could just take beta caroten instead of retinol supplement help ye but the effect will take a long time to develop my advis is to us retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta caroten to keep it full vitamin a is probabl on nutrient that is better off left to prescript by doctor but when we have the m d s in thi newsgroup jump all over me and other doctor that propos the us of vitamin a supplement for treat patient with chronic sinu and gi distress i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but requir manufactor to provid packag insert to educ the gener public about the danger of vitamin a supplement marti b
