subject re sinu vs migrain wa re sinu endoscopi i notic sever year ago that when i took analges fairli regularli motrin at the time i seem to get a lot of migrain but had forgotten about that until i start read some of the post here i gener don t take nsaid or tylenol for headach becaus i ve found them to be ineffect howev i have two other pain sourc that forc me to take nsaid current naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the begin of my period and then much wors at midcycl i have had surgeri for endometriosi in the past year ago so the dr tell me that my pain is probabl due to the endometriosi come back i ve tri synarel it reduc the pain while i took it mo but the pain return immedi after i stop three doctor have suggest hysterectomi as the onli real solut to my problem although i don t expect to have ani more children i don t like the idea of have my uteru and on remain ovari remov the first ovari wa remov when i had the surgeri for endometriosi on of the dr that suggest i get a hysterectomi is an expert in laser surgeri but perhap think that type of procedur is onli worthwhil on women who still plan to have children so basic all i m left with is tough out the pain thi would be imposs without naprosyn or someth similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me horribl gastriti a few year ago so i m through with it in fact naprosyn work veri well at elimin the pain if i take it regularli as i did when i had sever back pain and pain in both leg as i ll discuss in a moment gener though i wait until i have the pain befor i take the naprosyn but then it take sever hour for it reduc the pain it s actual quit effect at reduc the pain it just take quit a while in the meantim i m frequent in sever pain the other pain sourc i have is chronic lower back pain result in bilater radiculopathi i ve had mri xrai ct scan and emg i ve had of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerv conduct test the test have not been conclus as to what is caus my back and leg pain the mri report both sai i have sever bulg degeneratig disk and from the xrai and mri i think it is appar that i have arthriti the read on the ct scan wa that there ar two herniat l l and l l but other hav look at the film and conclud that there ar no herniat the second emg and nerv conduct studi show signific denerv compar to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horribl test call someth like somat evok respons which show that the intern nerv ar work fine anywai the bottom line is that i sometim have sever pain in both leg and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analges anti inflammatori medic to reduc the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulari for month everi time i tri to stop the leg pain got wors so i d alwai resum sinc last novemb i have taken it much less frequent and primarili for the pelvic pain i have been go to physic therapi for the last month time a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tri it earlier but it had caus a lot of pain in my back thi time she tri it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my leg began go awai but the traction awai caus discomfort in my lower back which could be reduc with ultrasound and massag so now i don t have nearli as much pain in my leg in fact my therapist took me off traction about week ago get back to my origin reason for thi post even if i can avoid take analges for headach i realli can t avoid them entir becaus i have other pain sourc that forc me to us them oh i forgot to mention that it ha been suggest to me that i have back surgeri but i m avoid that too i find the migrain difficult to deal with occassion i have to take off work but usual i can work but at a reduc capac i m a system engin and do a lot of read and write when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentr much i usual end up jump out of my chair everi few minut becaus the pain is so bothersom when the pain in my back is bad it can caus sever burn in both leg shoot pain in my leg electr shock type of pain in my feet and toe and basic when it get bad i can t realli sit at all then i end up spend most of my time home and in bed so even if the analges contribut to the migrain the migrain ar more toler than the other pain sourc i get a lot of migrain an averag of to a month which last dai i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffien realli got to me so i reduc the dosag but i don t like the side effect if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a veri bad headach i will eventu take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t veri help when i told him my problem with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becom avail i should try that i ve tri sever other medic fiornal midrin fiornal with codein tegretol and inder but thei either didn t work or i couldn t toler them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfi with me just try to toler the pain which i agre with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i ve had some bad experi with surgeri my heart stop onc from the anesthesia i wa told that it wa like the succinylcholin and i ve alreadi had surgeri sever time anywai the point of what i m sai is that even if analges can contribut to migrain some peopl need to take them to toler other pain janic rathmann
