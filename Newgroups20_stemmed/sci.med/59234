subject re cholistasi sp fat free diet pregnanc heart access digex com g write hi i ve just return from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concern that mayb y all can help me with i ve been see her everi week for the past few month i m at week and dure the last visit i ve gain to pound everi week she said thi wa unaccept over ani week period as it stand i ve thu far gain pound also she sai that though i m at week the babi s size is week i think she mention inch for the top of the fundu when i wa week the babi s size wa week i must also add that i had an oper a few year ago for endometriosi and i ve had no problem with endometriosi but appar it is caus me pain in my pelvic region dure the pregnanc and i have a veri difficult time move and the doc ha recommend i not walk or move unless i have to i have a littl handicap sticker for when i do need to go out anywai that s of the situat the other is that almost from the begin of pregnanc i wa get sick throw up about time a dai and mostli it wa bile that wa be elimin i told her about thi i know thi becaus i wasn t eat veri much due to the nausea and could see the result well now i onli get sick about onc everi week and it is still bile relat but in addit i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usual when i wa ly on my right side it began to get wors though becaus it start to hurt when i lai on my right side and then it hurt no matter what posit i wa in next i notic that when i at greasi or fatti food i felt like my entir abdomen had turn to stone and the pain in the area got wors howev if i at sauerkraut or vinegar or someth to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor sai i have cholistati and that i should avoid fatti food thi make sens and becaus i wa alreadi awar of what seem to me thi caus and effect relationship i have been avoid these food on my own but i m still abl to eat food with ricotta chees for instanc and other low fat food but doc want me to be on a non fat diet thi mean no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do thi anywai no nut fri food chees etc i am allow skim milk she said i should avoid anyth sweet e g banana also i must onli have on serv of someth high in carbohydr a dai potato pasta rice she said i can t even cook veget in a littl bit of oil and that i should eat veget raw or steam i m concern becaus i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digest process and if i m not take in fat is she expect the babi will take it from my store and why thi restrict on carbohydr if she s concern about fat i m not clear how much of her recommend is base on my weight gain and how much on cholistati which i can t seem to find ani inform on she origin said that i should onli gain pound dure the entir pregnanc sinc i wa about lb overweight when i start but my sister gain lb dure her pregnanc and she s taken it all off and hasn t had ani problem she also ask if ani member of my famili were obes which none of them ar anywai i think she is overli concern about weight gain and feel like i m be punish by a sever diet she did want to see me again in on week so i think she the diet mai be temporari for that on week what i want to know is how reason is thi non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet sinc i m try that anywai even if she said realli low fat diet i think she assum i must be eat a high fat diet but realli it is that becaus of the endometriosi and the oper i m not abl to us the energi from the food i do eat ani opinion info and experi will be appreci i m truli go stark rave mad try to meet thi new strict diet becaus fruit and veget go through my system in a few minut and i ll end up have to eat constantli thu far i don t find ani food satisfi thank g for on week she probabl want to see how you react to the diet if it chang anyth you can live on the diet but you need to up your calori where befor you had a pat of butter now you need a medium appl probabl microwav cook smaller meal but more of them not terrif amount of meat it s hard to digest anywai for comfort and to make the carbohydr meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calori up slowli rather than bread or corn mayb smaller meal as you mai be get less room in the stomach area is the babi still come up is it start to push or rub under your rib how tight ar your cloth you shouldn t be wear ani cloth that compress your middl be sure not to suck in your stomach when sit again it will put pressur on the digest tract try lai on your side back and stai in reclin posit for the mani hour you ar be inact easier on your leg circul as well you might try let the babi turn or at least not be forc under the rib dure the last month when you ar shortwaist it s easi for that babi to end up right under the diaphram especi if you have tight abdomin muscl if i had my second on to do over again i think i d have tri to loosen up sinc he didn t turn sidewai until late and the relief wa enorm mayb thi doctor doe have a thing about weight gain in pregnanc or mayb she just nag all her patient thi wai especi if she s young but thi gallbladd whatev problem that might be come up is someth to be avoid if possibl nausea etc can vari from person to person and with each pregnanc my first pregnanc wa miser dure the second i had veri littl troubl some articl have said that women with nausea had a statist better chanc of carri their babi grain of salt here good luck jacki
