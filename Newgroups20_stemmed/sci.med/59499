subject re chromium as dietari suppliment for weight loss in articl apr newsgat sp mot com rhca melton sp mot com henri melton write my wife ha request that i poll the sage of usenet to see what is known about the us of chromium in weight control diet suppliment she ha seen multipl product advertis it and would like ani kind real inform my first impuls wa yuck a metal but i have zero data on it what do you know henri melton i ll tell you all that i know about chromium but befor i do i want to get a few thing off my chest i just got blast in e mail for my kidnei stone post kidnei stone ar primarili caus by diet as is heart diseas and cancer when i give dietari advis it is not intend to encourag peopl read thi new group or sci med nutrit where i do most of my post to avoid see a doctor noth can be further from the truth kidnei stone can be caus by tumor and thi possibl ha to be rule out but onc it is diet is a good wai of prevent a reoccur same thing with heart diseas and cancer if you suspect that you mai have a problem with on of these diseas don t us what i m go to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid go to a doctor you have to go hopefulli you will find a doctor who know enough about nutrit to help you chang your risk factor for both diseas as part of a treatment program but the odd ar that you will not and that s why i m here when my wife detect a lump in here breast i didn t sai don t worri my vitamin e will take care of it ani breast lump ha to be work up by a physician plan and simpl if it s begnin which most ar fine then mayb a diet chang and supplement will prevent further breast lump from occur but let me tell you right now if you have tri diet and supplement and anoth lump return get your butt into the doctor s offic as fast as your littl feet can carri you better yet have a mammographi done on a regular basi my wife kept put her s off both myself and her gynocologist told her she need to have on done her gynocologist even schedul on but she didn t show up too busi run the oper room for the biggest hospit in tulsa on more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist thi group us high dose vitamin and miner to treat all kind of diseas there is absolut no doubt in my mind that vitamin and miner can and do have drug action in the bodi but you talk about fly blind man thi is realli blind treatment no drug could ever be us as these vitamin and miner ar be us i m not sai that some of thi stuff couldn t be right on the monei it mai well be but my approach to nutrit is a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two m d s who wrote the new clinic nutrit textbook my push is the nutrient reserv and the lab test need to measur these reserv and then supplement or diet chang to get these reserv built up to where thei should be to let you handl stress that s where i m come from folk blast awai if you want i m not go to chang put me in your killfil if you want i realli don t care i m averag e mail messag a dai from peopl who think that i ve got someth import to sai but i m also get hit by a few with an ax to grind that s life chromium is on of the trace element it ha a veri limit but veri import role in the bodi it is us to form glucos toler factor gtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamid niacin glycin cystein and glutam onli the chromium and the niacin ar need from the diet to form gtf some food alreadi have gtf liver brewer or nutrit yeast and black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretti good absorpt is seen about but when it is simpli present as a miner or miner chelat chromium picolin it s absorpt is much lower to lowest for all the miner i ve been post in misc fit and chromium ha come up there sever time as a fat burner chromium is among the least toxic of the miner so you could realli load yourself up and not realli do ani harm i wouldn t do it though the adequ and safe rang for chromium is to ug per dai the averag american is get about ug per dai from hi her diet chromium level decreas with ag and mani believ that adult onset diabet is primarili a chromium defici i can cite you sever studi that have been done with glucos toler in type ii diabet but i m not go to becaus for each posit on there also seem to be a neg on as well i m convinc that the problem is bioavail when yeast gtf is us good result ar obtain but when chromium itself is us the result ar usual neg in addit to type ii diabet chromiuum ha been examin in cardiovascular diseas and glucoma again with mix result as far as cardiovascular diseas is concern sinc a high blood glucos level can lead to cardiovascular diseas thi possibl link with chromium isn t too surpris glucoma is a littl more interest muscl ey focus activ is primarili an insulin respons glucos driven metabol function if thi ey focus activ is impair by a lack of glucos due to a poor insulin respons intraocular pressur is believ to be elev in a fairli larg studi of pt with glaucoma the on consist find wa a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr but thi on preliminari studi should not prompt peopl to go out and start pop chromium supplement for on thing just about everi older person is go to have a low rbc chromium unless thei have been take chromium suppleemnt yeast sinc glucoma is often found in older peopl it s not too surpris that chromium wa low in the rbc s if chromium supplement could revers glucoma that would prompt some attent i suspect that there will be a clinic trail to check out thi possibl chromium link to glucoma you could find out what your bodi chromium pool size wa by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysi most clinic lab ar not go to run a rbc chromium there ar plenti of lab that will do a hair and nail analysi for you but i wouldn t us them there is just too much funni busi go on in these unregul lab right now here s weinsier and morgan advis on chromium thei do not consid chromium to be on of those miner for which a reliabl clinic test is avail thei don t like the hair and nail analysi lab either and thei also recogn the rbc chromium is primarili a research test that is not routin avail in most clinic chemistri lab thi ha to chang and as more lab run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do thei suggest make a diagnosi of chromium defici base on a document clinic respons to chromium run a glucos toler test befor and after chromium supplement onc you make the diagnosi put the patient on ug of crcl oral each dai or gram of yeast per dai what s my advis don t take chromium supplement to try to loos weight thei just do not work that wai if you want to take them and then exercis that would be great do includ yeast as part of your diet most american ar not get enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucos toler ask your doctor to check your chromium statu when he or she sai what in the world ar you talk about just sai pleas get a copi of weinsier and morgan s new clinic nutrit textbook and do what thei sai to do with patient who present with a poor glucos toler if you can t do that i ll find a doctor who can thank you veri much marti b
