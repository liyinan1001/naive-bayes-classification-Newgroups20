subject great post wa re candida yeast bloom veri long great post martin veri inform well balanc and humanitarian without neglect the need for scientif rigor cross post to alt psycholog person sinc some person type will be discuss at the begin note i ve set all followup to sci med sinc most of my comment ar more sci med orient and i m sure most of the repli if ani will be med relat in articl banschbach vm ocom okstat edu write i can not believ the wai thi thread on candida yeast ha progress steve dyer and i have been exchang word over the same topic in sci med nutrit when he displai hi typic reserv and attack a woman poster for be treat by a licenc physician for a diseas that did not exist call thi physician a quack wa reprehens steve and i see that you and some of the other ar do it here as well thei ar just respond in their natur wai hyper choler syndrom hc oop that is not a recogn ill in the psycholog commun better not sai that sinc it therefor must not and never will exist actual it is fascin that a disproportion number of physician will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myer brigg system just e mail me and i ll send a summari file to you in the gener popul nt s compris onli about of the popul but among physician it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentag ani help here a p p er s on drive characterist of an nt especi an ntj is their obviou choler behavior driver type a etc the extrem emot need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most compet if thei ar also extrovert thei ar best describ as field marshal thi trait is veri valuabl and essenti in our societi we need peopl who want to lead to strive to overcom the element to seek and thirst for knowledg to rais the level of compet etc the great success in scienc and technolog ar in larg part due to the vision an n trait and scientif mind approach t trait of the nt person of cours the other type and tempera have their own posit contribut as well howev when the nt person ha self imag challeng the dark side of thi person type usual come out which should be obviou to all a physician who is a strong nt and who ha not learn to temper their tempera will be extrem busi like lack of empathi or feel and is veri compel to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedi to their diagnosi and prescript without question i ve known mani m d s of thi tempera and suffic to sai i don t oblig them with a followup visit no matter how compet i think thei ar and thei usual ar veri compet from a knowledg viewpoint sinc that is an extrem drive of their to know the most to know it all mayb we need more nf doctor s enough on thi subject let s move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quack realli ar these ar the physican who have no idea how the human bodi interact with it s environ and how that balanc can be alter by diet and antibiot could it just be profession jealousi i couldn t help elain or jon but somebodi els did you ve help me alreadi by your post of cours i believ that i have been misdiagnos on the net as suffer from anal retent but be the phlegmat i am mayb i wa just a littl too harsh on a few peopl myself in past post let s all try to rais the level of thi discuss abov the level of anal effluent human have all kind of differ organ live in the gi system mouth stomach small and larg intestin sinus vagina and on the skin these ar nonpathogen becaus thei do not caus diseas in peopl unless the immun system is compromis thei ar also call nonpathogen becaus unlik the pathogen organ that caus human diseas thei do not produc toxin as thei live out their merri exist in and on our bodi but ani of these organ will be consid pathogen if it manag to take up resid within the bodi a poor mucu membran barrier can let thi happen and vitamin a is mainli respons for set up thi barrier in my well describ situat in prior post i definit wa immun stress blood test show my vitamin a level were veri low my sinus were a mess no doubt the mucos line and the cilia were heavili damag i also wa on antibiot time in year in the end even two week of ceftin did not work and i had confirm diagnos of a chronic bacteri infect of the sinus via cat scan mucu color won t get into the detail and other symptom three veri tradit ent s made thi diagnosi i did not have ani cultur done howev becaus of the difficulti of do thi right and becaus my other symptom clearli show a bacteri infect enough of thi background provid to help you understand where i wa when i make comment about my sporanox anti fungal therapi below the first question i have is thi can fungu penetr a littl wai into poor mucu membran tissu mayb via hypha thu caus symptom without be consid system in the classic sens it is sort of an inbetween infect steve got real upset with elain s doctor becaus he wa us anti fungal and vitamin a for her gi problem if steve realli understoood what vitamin a doe in the bodi he would not or at least should not be call elain s doctor a quack i wa concern too becaus of the toxic of vitamin a my doctor after my blood test put me on iu of vitamin a for on week onli then drop it down to iu for the next coupl of week i also receiv zinc and other supplement sinc all of these interrel in fairli complex wai as my doctor explain he s on of those evil orthomolecular specialist i had a blood test three week later and vitamin a wa normal he then stop me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that i maintain a iu dai of beta caroten call me carrot face hopefulli elain s doctor will take a similar care approach and to all supplement i m even reevalu some supplement i m take for exampl niacin in fairli larg dosag gram dai which steve dyer had good inform about on sci med nutrit if niacin onli ha second order improv in symptomat relief of my sinu allergi then it probabl is not worth take such a larg dose long term and risk liver damag surviv if it get access to a lot of glucos it bloom and over ride the other organ live with it in the sinus gi tract or vagina in though i do now believ base on my success therapi with sporanox that i definit had some excess growth of fungu unknown speci in my sinus i still want to ask the question have there been ani studi that demonstr candida bloom in the sinus with associ sinu irrit sinus rhiniti my sinu irrit reduc significantli after on week of sporanox and no other new treatment were implement dure thi time i did not have ani notic gi track problem befor start on sporanox but some for a few dai after which then went awai consid normal btw my doctor dug out on of hi medic refer book sorri can t rememb which on and found an obscur comment date back into the s which state that peopl can develop contain non lethal or non seriou aspergilli infest aspergiliosi of the sinus lead to sinu inflamm symptom i ll have to dig out that refer again sinc it is relev to thi discuss some peopl do realli develop a bad inflammatori process at the mucu membran or skin bloom site whether thi is an allerg like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain my doctor test me i believ a rast or rast similar test for allerg respons to specifici candida albican and i show a strong posit anoth question would everybodi show the same strong posit so thi test is essenti useless and assum it is true that candida can grow part wai into the mucu membran tissu and the concentr exce a threshold amount could not a person who test as have an allergi to candida definit develop allerg symptom such as mucu membran irrit due to the bodi s allerg respons as i said in an earlier post on doe not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degre or a ph d in biochemistri to see the plausibl of thi hypothesi btw and i ll repost thi again dr ivker in hi book sinu surviv ha routin given befor anyth els nizor a pre sporanox system anti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to hi new chronic sinus patient if thei have been on antibiot four or more time in the last two year he claim that out of or so patient well over notic some relief of sinu inflamm and other symptom but it doesn t cure it by ani mean impli the so call yeast fungu infect is not the primari caus but a later complic he s also found that nystatin whether taken intern or put into a sinu sprai doe not help thi impli of cours assum that excess yeast fungu bloom is aggrav the sinu inflamm that the yeast fungu ha grown partwai into the tissu sinc nystatin will not kill yeast fungu other than by direct contact it is not absorb into the blood stream again i admit lot of if and impli which doesn t pleas the hard core nt who ha to have the doubl blind studi or it s a non issu but on ha to start with some plausibl hypothesi explan a strawman if you will if it s intern onli symptom can be us and these symptom ar pretti nondescript thi bring up an interest observ us by those who will deni and reject ani and all aspect of the yeast hypothesi until the appropri studi ar done and that is if you can t observ or cultur the yeast bloom in the gut or sinu then there s no wai to diagnos or even recogn the diseas and i know thei realiz that it is virtual imposs to test for candida overbloom in ani part of the bodi that cannot be easili observ sinc candida is everywher in the bodi it s a real catch anoth catch those who total reject the yeast hypothesi sai that no studi have been done actual studi have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspect a non studi which should not even be consid i agre that the appropri studi should be done and that will take big to do it right howev in order to convinc the fund agenc in these auster time to open their wallet you liter have to give them evid and the onli accept evid to compet with other propos is paradox to do almost the exact studi need fund that is you have to do of the studi befor you even get fund as a scientist at a nation lab i m veri awar of thi for the smaller fund project i m afraid that even if dr ivker and other doctor got togeth pool their practic s case histori and anecdot into a compel pictur and approach the fund agenc thei would get nowher even if thei were abl to publish their statist result it is obviou from the comment by some of the doctor here is that thei have decid excess yeast colon in the gut or sinus lead to notic non lethal symptom doe not exist and is not even a tenabl hypothesi so ani amount of case histori or compil anecdot evid to the contrari will never chang their mind and not onli that thei would also oppos the need studi becaus in their mind it s a done issu excess yeast growth lead to diffus allerg symptom doe not will not and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of remind me of lister candida is kept in check in most peopl by the normal bacteri flora in the sinus the gi tract mouth stomach and intestin and in the vagin tract which compet with it for food the human immun system usus doe not bother itself with these nonpathogen organ unless thei broach the mucu membran barrier if thei do an inflammatori respons will be set up most american ar not get enough vitamin a from their diet about of all american s die with less vitamin a than thei were born with u s autopsi studi while thi low level of vitamin a doe not caus patholog blind it doe impair the mucu membran barrier system thi would then be a predispos factor for a strong inflammatori respons after a candida bloom aren t there also other nutrient necessari to the proper work of the sinu mucu membran and cilia while diabet can suffer from a candida bloom the most common caus of thi type of bloom is the us of broad spectrum antibiot which knock down mani differ kind of bacteria in the bodi and remov the main competit for candida as far as food is concern while drug ar avail to handl candida mani patient find that their doctor will not us them unless there is evid of a system infect the toxic of the anti fungal drug doe warrant some caution but if the gi or sinu inflamm is suspect to be candida and recent us of a broad spectrum antibiot is the smoke gun then anti fungal us should be approrpri just as the anti fungal cream ar an appropri treatment for recur vagin yeast infect in spite of what mr steve dyer sai again the evid from mycolog studi indic that mani yeast fungu speci can grow hypha root into deep tissu similar to mold grow in bread you can continu to kill the surfac such as nystatin doe but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissu without us a system anti fungal such as itraconazol sporanox or some of the older on such as nizor which ar more toxic and not as effect thi is why as ha been point out by recent studi sent to me by a doctor i ve been in e mail contact with thank that nystatin is not effect in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasi it s like try to weed a garden by cut off what s abov the ground but leav the root readi to come out again onc you walk awai the question is whether a contain candida bloom can partial grow into tissu through the mucu membran caus some type of symptom in suscept peopl e g allergi without becom system in the classic sens of the word someth in between strictli an excess bloom not caus ani problem and the full blown system infect that is potenti lethal in the gi system the ano rectal region seem to be a particularli good reservoir for candida and the us of pantyhos by mani women creat a veri favor environ around the rectum for transfer through moistur and humid of candida to the vagin tract on of the most effctiv wai to minimm thi transfer is to wear undi cotton underwear also if on is an anal retent like i ve been diagnos in a prior post that can also provid more site for excess candida growth if the bloom occur in the anal area the burn swell pain and even blood discharg make mani patient think that thei have hemorroid if the bloom manag to move further up the gi tract veri diffus symptomatolog occur abdomin discomfort and blood in the stool thi posit stool for occult blood is what sent elain to her famili doctor in the first place after extens test he told her that there wa noth wrong but her gut still hurt on to anoth doctor and so on richard kaplan ha told me throiugh e mail that he consid occult blood test in stool specimen to be a wast of time and monei becaus of the veri larg number of fals posit candida bloom gui if my gut hurt me on a constant basi i would want it fix ye it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is caus my distress when i final find a doctor who treat me and get me better steve dyer call him a quack as i ve said in privat e mail there ar flaw in our current medic system that make it difficult or even imposs for a physician to attempt altern therapi after the approv proven accept therapi don t work for exampl i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to live with my acut chronic sinus after the ab s fail thei did mention surgeri to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plug and it would not get to the root caus of my condit after three month of aggress and fairli non standard therapi sporanox bodi nutrient level monitor and equal vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health ha vastli improv to where i wa two year ago befor my health greatli deterior of cours skeptic would sai that mayb if i did noth i would have improv anywai but that view is stretch thing quit far becaus of the experi of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live with it i m confid i will reach what on could call a total cure the anti fungal program i undertook wa on necessari step in that direct becaus of my overus of ab s for the last four year note for those have sinu problem mai i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention abov be sure to get the revis edit i have often wonder what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinu problem would do about the problem that he tell hi patient is a non exist syndrom dr ivker start off have chronic and sever sinu problem and hi visit to sever ent s total floor him when thei said you ll just have to live with it he spent sever year try everyth standard and non standard until he wa essenti cure of chronic sinus he now share hi approach in hi book and i can honestli sai that i am on the road to recoveri follow some part of it hi on recommend to take a system anti fungal at the begin of treatment if you have a histori of anti biotic overus ha been proven to him time and time again in hi own practic i m sure if i comment to him of the hard core belief of the anti yeast hypothesi poster that he would have definit thing to sai such as it s work wonder for me in almost two thousand case to put it mildli i also would not be surpris if he would sai that thei ar the on violat their moral oblig to help the patient mayb those doctor who ar read thi who have a practic and ar confront by a patient have symptom that could be due to the hypothet yeast overgrowth e g thei fit some of the profil the pro yeast peopl have identifi should consid anti fungal therapi if all other avenu have been exhaust rememb theori and practic ar two differ thing you cannot have on without the other thei ar synergist if a doctor doe someth non standard yet produc notic symptomat relief in over a thousand of hi patient shouldn t you at least sit up and take notic mayb you ought to trust what he sai and begin hypothes why it work instead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctor have becom so enamor with scientif correct that thei ar ignor the patient thei have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanc which we don t see from some of the poster to thi group there come a point when you just have to us a littl common sens and mayb an empir approach such as try a good system anti fungal such as sporanox after have exhaust all the other avenu i wa on of those who the tradit medic establish wa not abl to help so i did the natur thing i went to a coupl of doctor s who ar somewhat outsid thi establish and as a result i have found signific relief would it not be better if the tradit medic establish can set up some kind of mechan where ani doctor without fear of be su or have hi licens pull can try experiment and unproven beyond a doubt therapi for hi her patient that final reach the point where all the accept therapi ar ineffect i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tri all the therapi that ar approv and accept in thi countri and sinc thei clearli don t work for you i now have the author to us experiment unproven techniqu that seem to have help other i can t promis anyth and there ar some risk you will have to sign someth sai you understand the experiment and possibl riski natur of these unproven therapi and i ll have to regist your case at the state board anywai if my ent had suggest thi to me i would ve jump on thi pronto instead of go to on of those doctor who for either altruist reason or for greed is practic these altern therapi with much risk to him her risk mean lose their licens and possibl to the patient such a mechan would keep control in the more mainstream medicin and also provid valuabl data that would essenti be free it also would be moral and ethic better than the current system by show the compass of the medic commun to the patient that it s do everyth it can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechan that is lead larg number of peopl to try altern therapi some of which seem to work like my case and other of which will never work at all true quackeri i better get off my soapbox befor thi post reach k in size if taken oral it can also becom a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprai it ha also been us to innocul the sinu membran but befor thi innocul occur the mucu membran barrier system need to be strengthen thi is accomplish by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamin diet survei repeatedli show that american ar not get enough b and folat these ar probabl the segement of the popul that will have the greatest problem with thi non exist disord candida bloom after antibiot therapi what dosag of b appear to be necessari to promot the heal and proper work of the muco memebran some of the abov materi wa obtain from natur heal by mark bricklin publish by rodal press as well as note from my human nutrit cours i will be post a discuss of vitamin a sometim in the futur along with refer cite to point out the extrem import role that vitamin a plai in the mucu membran defens system in the bodi and why vitamin a should be effect in deal with candida bloom anoth effect dietari treatment is to restrict carbohydr intak dure the treatment phase thi is especi import if the gi system is involv if candida can not get glucos it s not go to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can us amino acid and fatti acid for energi a chanc to take over and keep the candida in check onc carbohydr is return to the gut i d like to see the role of complex carbohydr such as starch if steve and some of the other nai sayer want to jump all over thi post fine i jump all over steve in sci med nutrit becaus he verbabl accost a poster who wa seek advic about her doctor s us of vitamin a and anti fungal for a candida bloom in her gut peopl seek advic from newsnet should not be treat thi wai those of us give of our time and knowledg can slug it out to our heart s content if you save your venom for me steve and left the helpless poster who ar timidli seek help alon i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior brave soul you ar the venom on usenet can be quit toxic unless on develop an immun to it on year ago my phlegmat self would have back down right awai from an attack of choler but my immun system and my comput system have been harden from gradual desensit i now kind of like be call anal retent it ha a nice ring to it i also wa veri impress by how it just flow into
