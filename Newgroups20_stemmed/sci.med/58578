main type local condit and diffus condit local problem ar what you d expect specif muscl tendon tendon sheath nerv etc be inflam or otherwis hurt diffus condit often mistaken for local problem can involv muscl discomfort pain burn and or tingl with identifi area of tender in muscl although thei re not necessarili the problem why doe occup overus syndrom occur here s the theori normal your muscl and tendon get blood through capillari which pass among the muscl fiber when you tens a muscl you restrict the blood flow by the time you re exert of your full power you re complet restrict your blood flow without fresh blood your muscl us store energi until thei run out then thei switch to anaerob without oxygen metabol which gener nasti by product like lactic acid which caus pain onc on muscl hurt all it neighbor tens up perhap to reliev the load thi make sens for your normal sort of injuri but it onli make thing wors with repetit motion more tension mean less blood flow and the cycl continu anoth by product of the lack of blood flow is tingl and numb from your nerv thei need blood too anywai when you re type too much you re never realli give a chang for the blood to get back where it belong becaus your muscl never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor postur and poor ergonom onli make thing wors specif injuri you mai have heard of note most injuri come in two flavor acut and chronic acut injuri ar sever pain and notic chronic condit have less pronounc symptom but ar everi bit as real tenosynov an inflam of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynov occur when the repetit activ is mild or intermitt not enough to caus acut inflam but enough to exce the tendon sheath s abil to lubric the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thicken get inflam and you ve got your problem tendon an inflamm of a tendon repeat tens of a tendon can caus inflam eventu the fiber of the tendon start separ and can even break leav behind debri which induc more friction more swell and more pain sub acut tendon is more common which entail a dull ach over the wrist and forearm some tender and it get wors with repetit activ carpal tunnel syndrom the nerv that run through your wrist into your finger get trap by the inflam muscl around them symptom includ feel pin and needl tingl numb and even loss of sensat ct is often confus for a diffus condit advers mechan tension also known as neural tension thi is where the nerv run down to your arm have becom contract and possibl compress as a result of muscl spasm in the shoulder and elsewher amt can often misdiagnos as or associ with on of the other oo disord it is larg revers and can be treat with physiotherapi brachial plexu stretch and trigger point therapi other for just about everi part of your bodi there s a fanci name for a wai to injur it by now you should be get an idea of how oo condit occur and why just be care mani inexperienc doctor misdiagnos problem as carpal tunnel syndrom when in realiti you mai have a complet differ problem alwai get a second opinion befor somebodi doe someth drastic to you like surgeri type postur ergonom prevent treatment the most import element of both prevent and recoveri is to reduc tension in the muscl and tendon thi requir learn how to relax if you re under a load of stress thi is doubli import tune out the world and breath deep and regular relax should becom a guid principl in your work everi three minut take a three second break everi three minut take a three second break realli do it everi three minut it s also help to work in comfort surround calm down and relax if you

prevent bad postur surgeri can fix some problem exercis can help strengthen your muscl regular stretch can help prevent injuri good postur and a good ergonom workspac promot reduc tension ic or hot cold contrast bath also reduc swell onli your doctor can sai what s best for you postur here ar some basic guidelin i so like the wai thi wa written in the new zealand book that i m lift it almost verbatim from appendix dwallach let your shoulder relax let your elbow swing free keep your wrist straight pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try lean back in the chair don t slouch or slump forward alter your postur from time to time everi minut get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undu pressur on the undersid of your thigh near the knee and your thigh should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that it height is comfort to work at if you ar short thi mai be imposs the beest remedi is to rais the seat height and prevent your leg from dangl by us a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttock fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust it tilt to give firm support in thi area if you oper a keyboard you will be abl to spend more time lean back so experi with a chair with a taller backrest if avail now i diverg a littl from the text a good chair make a big differ if you don t like your chair go find a better on you realli want adjust for height back angl back height and mayb even seat tilt most arm rest seem to get in the wai although some more expens chair have height adjust arm rest which you can also rotat out of the wai you should find a good store and plai with all these chair pick on that s right for you in the san francisco bai area i highli recommend just chair the name sai it all keyboard drawer wrist pad and keyboard replac there is a fair amount of controveri on how to get thi right for some peopl wrist pad seem to work wonder howev with good postur you shouldn t be rest your wrist on anyth you would prefer your keyboard to be right there if you drop your arm at your side and then lift your hand up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hand when your elbow ar at about degre of cours you want to avoid pronat wrist extens and ulnar deviat at all cost wrist pad mai or mai not help at thi you should get somebodi els to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it s often easier for somebodi els to notic your hunch shoulder or deviat hand some argu that the normal flat keyboard is antiqu and poorli design a number of replac ar
