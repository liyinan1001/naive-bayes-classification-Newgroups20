subject re is msg sensit superstit in articl apr spdcc com dyer spdcc com steve dyer write in articl apr cunew carleton ca wcsbeau alfr carleton ca opirg write there ha been no hard info provid about msg make peopl ill that s the point after all why don t you just look it up in the merk or check out the medic dictionari cite which a doctor mention earlier in thi thread that s becaus these peer review studi ar not address the effect of msg in peopl thei re look at anim model you can t walk awai from thi and start rant about gloom and doom as if there were ani document deleteri health effect demonstr in human note that i wouldn t have ani argument with a statement like note that anim administr ha pro duce the follow blah blah we must be care about it us in human thi is precis not what you said among other see olnei s excitotox food adit relev of anim studi to human safeti neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i m sure peta would love to hear your argument test have been done on rhesu monkei as well i have never seen a studi where the mode of administr wa intra ventricular the glu and asp were administ oral some studi us iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studi for obviou reason you must not have read the peer review work that i refer to or you would never have come up with thi brain inject bunk it most certainli is for neurotoxicolog you know studi of glutam involv more than food scienc whose talk about food scienc what is thi comment suppos to mean neurotoxicolog and tratolog brain research natur progress in brain research all fine food scienc journal pardon me but where ar you get thi from have you read the journal have you done a thorough literatur search so point us to the studi in human pleas i m familiar with the literatur and i ve never seen ani which relat at all to olnei s work in anim and the effect of glutam on neuron then you would know that olnei himself ha casual refer to chines restaur syndrom in a few articl why don t you point us to some studi mayb then thi exchang could be product the point is exceed the window of cours thei re amino acid note that peopl with pku cannot toler ani phenylalanin well actual thei have to toler some phenylalanin it s a essenti amino acid thei just try to get as littl as is healthi without produc danger level of phenylalanin and it metabolit in the blood thei re unabl to metabolis it olnei s research compar infant human diet specif the amount of freeli avail glu in mother s milk versu commerci babi food vs typic lunch item from the standard american diet such as packag soup mix he found that on could exce the project safeti margin for infant human by at least four fold in a singl meal of process food mother s milk wa well below the effect dose good i m not sai that it s good to feed infant a lot of glutam supplement food it s just that thi project safeti margin is a construct deriv from anim model and given that you can prove anyth you like we re talk prudent polici in infant nutrit here yet you re misrepres it as receiv wisdom who said anyth about receiv wisdom there is no question that oral administ dose of msg ar capabl of destroi nearli all neuron in the arcuat nucleu of the hypothalamu and the median emin these area ar respons for the product of hormon critic to normal neuroendocrin function and the normal develop of the vertabr organ human ar vertebr now what prai tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessari for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin releas is miss ar you try to sai that human have no need of their pituitari anh and me of that part of the brain that is respons for control the realeas albeit indirectli of estradiol and testosteron how do you expect anyon to do the studi on thi it s uneth to sacrific human to check out what effect chronic acut etc dose of these compound ar have on the brain tissu in human the food industri know thi that s why the anim model is us in medicin and psych if you re talk about straight sensit it would be us to defin the term there ar plenti of studi on psychoneuroimmunolog show the link between attitud and physiolog i suspect we mai be argu about separ thing onli adult sensit you and late occur sequela of childhood ingest and it implic for adult me certainli the dose for excitotox in adult ar consider larger than for the young but the addit of glu and asp and their copiou and increas presenc in modern process food jointli and their hidden presenc in hvp necessit extrem caution why would anyon want to eat compound which have been shown to markedli perturb the endocrin system in adult the main point is blood level attain and oral dose would like have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interest in see you provid peer review non food industri fund citat to articl disput that msg ha no effect whatsoev you mean assert you re be intellectu dishonest or just plain confus becaus you re conflat report which do not necessarili have anyth to do with each other olnei s report would argu a potenti for problem in human infant but that s not to sai that thi sai anyth whatsoev about the us of msg in most food nor doe he provid ani studi in human which indic ani deleteri effect for obviou reason it sai noth about msg s contribt to the phenomenon of the chines restaur syndrom it sai noth about the frequent inabl to replic anecdot report of msg sensit in the lab olnei s work provid a put causal mechan for some sensit terri epelbaum and martin have shown that oral administ msg caus chang in normal gonadotrop hormon fluctut in adult glu also wa found to induc immedi and persist supress of rhythmic gh secret and to induc rapid and transient releas of prolactin in adult chronic expos to msg gh is respons not onli for control of growth dure develop but also convert glycogen into glucos could thi be the caus of headach i don t know dyer ursa major spdcc com hmm com why am i not surpris diann murrai wcsbeau
