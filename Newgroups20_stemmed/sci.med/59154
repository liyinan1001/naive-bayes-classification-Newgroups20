the field for comput scientist who wish to appli their tool to thi rich and complex domain materi cover will includ structur and inform molecul the basic organ of the cell and of genet materi the central dogma of gene express and select other topic in the area of structur function and regul as relat to current comput approach dr noordewi ha appoint in both comput scienc and biologi at rutger and ha extens experi in basic biolog research in addit to hi current work in comput biologi pm introduct to artifici intellig for biologist dr richard lathrop mit arri corp an overview of the field of artifici intellig will be present as it relat to actual and potenti biolog applic fundament techniqu symbol program languag and notion of search will be discuss as well as select topic in somewhat greater detail such as knowledg represent infer and machin learn the intend audienc includ biologist with some comput background but no extens exposur to artifici intellig dr lathrop co develop of

laped lo alamo nation laboratori thi tutori will cover the most rapidli expand facet of intellig system for molecular biologi that of machin learn techniqu appli to sequenc analysi close interrel topic to be address includ the us of artif neural network to elicit both specif signal and gener characterist of sequenc and the relationship of such approach to statist techniqu and inform theoret view of sequenc data dr laped of the theoret divis at lo alamo ha long been a leader in the us of such techniqu in thi domain pm genet algorithm and genet program prof john koza stanford univers the genet algorithm an increasingli popular approach to highli non linear multi dimension optim problem wa origin inspir by a biolog metaphor thi tutori will cover both the biolog motiv and the actual implement and characterist of the algorithm genet program an extens well suit to problem where the discoveri of the size and shape of the solut is a major part of the problem will also be address particular attent will be paid to biolog applic and to identifi resourc and softwar that will permit attende to begin us the method dr koza a consult professor of comput scienc at stanford ha taught
