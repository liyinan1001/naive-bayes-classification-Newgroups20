subject candida yeast bloom fact or fiction i can not believ the wai thi thread on candida yeast ha progress steve dyer and i have been exchang word over the same topic in sci med nutrit when he displai hi typic reserv and attack a women poster for be treat by a liscenc physician for a diseas that did not exist call thi physician a quack wa reprehens steve and i see that you and some of the other ar do it here as well let me tell you who the quack realli ar these ar the physican who have no idea how the human bodi interact with it s environ and how that balanc can be alter by diet and antibiot these ar the physician who dismiss their patient with difficult symptomatolog and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elain in sci med nutrit and then when thei find on that solv their problem the rest start yell quack could it just be profession jealousi i couldn t help elain or jon but somebodi els did could thei know more than me no wai thei must be a quack i ve been teach a human nutrit cours for medic student for over ten year now and guess who the most recept student ar those that were rais on farm and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm anim and those student who had made a dramat diet chang prior to enter medic school switch to the vegan diet typic thi is about of my class of student those not interest in nutrit either tune me out or just stop come to class that s okai becaus i know that some of what i m teach is go to stick and there will be at least a few enlighten physician practic in the u s it s realli too bad that most u s medic school don t cover nutrit becaus if thei did candida would not be view as a non diseas by so mani in the medic profess in anim husbandri an anim is reinnocul with good bacteria after antibiot ar stop medicin ha decid that sinc human do not have a rumin stomach no such reinnocul with good bacteria is need after come off a braod spectrum antibiot human have all kind of differ organ live in the gi system mouth stomach small and larg intestin sinus vagina and on the skin these ar nonpathogen becaus thei do not caus diseas in peopl unless the immun system is compromis thei ar also call nonpathogen becaus unlik the pathogen organ that caus human diseas thei do not produc toxin as thei live out their merri exist in and on our bodi but ani of these organ will be consid pathogen if it manag to take up resid within the bodi a poor mucu membran barrier can let thi happen and vitamin a is mainli respons for set up thi barrier steve got real upset with elain s doctor becaus he wa us anti fungal and vitamin a for her gi problem if steve realli understoood what vitamin a doe in the bodi he would not or at least should not be call elain s doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infect as thei ar commonli call ar not trueli caus by yeast the most common organ respons for thi type of infect is candida albican or monilia which is actual a yeast like fungu an infect caus by thi organ is call candidiasi candidiasi is a veri rare occur becaus like an e coli infect it requir that the host immun system be severli depress candida is frequent found on the skin and all of the mucou membran of normal healthi peopl and it rare becom a problem unless some predispos factor is present such as a high blood glucos level diabet or an oral cours of antibiot ha been us in diabet their secret contain much higher amount of glucos candida unlik bacteria is veri limit in it s food fuel select without glucos it can not grow it just bare surviv if it get access to a lot of glucos it bloom and over ride the other organ live with it in the sinus gi tract or vagina in diabet skin lesion can also foster a good bloom site for these littl bugger the bloom is usual just a minor irrit in most peopl but some peopl do realli develop a bad inflammatori process at the mucu membran or skin bloom site whether thi is an allerg like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easlii seen and some doctor do then try to treat it if it s intern onli symptom can be us and these symptom ar pretti nondiscript candida is kept in check in most peopl by the normal bacteri flora in the sinus the gi tract mouth stomach and intestin and in the vagin tract which compet with it for food the human immun system usus doe not bother itself with these nonpathogen organ unless thei broach the mucu membran barrier if thei do an inflammatori respons will be set up most american ar not get enough vitamin a from their diet about of all american s die with less vitamin a than thei were born with u s autopsi studi while thi low level of vitamin a doe not caus patholog blind it doe impair the mucu membran barrier system thi would then be a predispos factor for a strong inflammatori respons after a candida bloom while diabet can suffer from a candida bloom the most common caus of thi type of bloom is the us of broad spectrum antibiot which knock down mani differ kind of bacteria in the bodi and remov the main competit for candida as far as food is concern while drug ar avail to handl candida mani patient find that their doctor will not us them unless there is evid of a system infect the toxic of the anti fungal drug doe warrant some caution but if the gi or sinu inflamm is suspect to be candida and recent us of a broad spectrum antibiot is the smoke gun then anti fungal us should be approrpri just as the anti fungal cream ar an appropri treatment for recur vagin yeast infect in spite of what mr steve dyer sai but even in patient be given the anti fungal the irrit caus by the excess candida bloom in the sinu gi tract or the vagina tend to return after drug treatment is discontinu unless the underli caus of the problem is address lack of a good bacteri flora in the bodi and or poor mucu membran barrier lactobacillu acidophilu is the most effect therapi for candida overgrowth from it s name it is an acid love organ and it set up an acid condit were it grow candida can not grow veri well in an acid environ in the vagina l acidophiliu is the predomin bacteria unless you ar hit with broad spectrum antibiot in the gi system the ano rectal region seem to be a particularli good reservoir for candida and the us of pantyhos by mani women creat a veri favor environ around the rectum for transfer through moistur and humid of candida to the vagin tract on of the most effctiv wai to minimm thi transfer is to wear undi cotton underwear if the bloom occur in the anal area the burn swell pain and even blood discharg make mani patient think that thei have hemorroid if the bloom manag to move further up the gi tract veri diffus symptomatolog occur abdomin discomfort and blood in the stool thi posit stool for occult blood is what sent elain to her famili doctor in the first place after extens test he told her that there wa noth wrong but her gut still hurt on to anoth doctor and so on richard kaplan ha told me throiugh e mail that he consid occult blood test in stool specimen to be a wast of time and monei becaus of the veri larg number of fals posit candida bloom gui if my gut hurt me on a constant basi i would want it fix ye it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is caus my distress when i final find a doctor who treat me and get me better steve dyer call him a quack candida prefer a slightli alkalin environ while bacteria tend to prefer a slightli acid environ the vagina becom alkalin dure a woman s period and thi is often when candida bloom in the vagina vinegar and water douch ar the best wai of deal with vagin problem mani women have also gotten relief from the introduct of lactobacillu directli into the vagin tract i would want to be sure of the puriti of the product befor try thi my wife had thi vagina problem after go on birth control pill and search for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solv the problem rather than just writ script for anti fungal cream thi wa a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recur vagin yeast infect thi m d did some dig and came up with an acet acid and l acidophili douch which she us in your offic to keep it steril after three treatment sex return to our marraig i have often wonder what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinu problem would do about the problem that he tell hi patient is a non exist syndrom the nonpathogen bacteria l acidophilu is an acid produc bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vagin tract of healthi women if taken oral it can also becom a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprai it ha also been us to innocul the sinu membran but befor thi innocul occur the mucu membran barrier system need to be strengthen thi is accomplish by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamin diet survei repeatedli show that american ar not get enough b and folat these ar probabl the segement of the popul that will have the greatest problem with thi non exist disord candida bloom after antibiot therapi some of the abov materi wa obtain from natur heal by mark bricklin publish by rodal press as well as note from my human nutrit cours i will be post a discuss of vitamin a sometim in the futur along with refer cite to point out the extrem import role that vitamin a plai in the mucu membran defens system in the bodi and why vitamin a should be effect in deal with candida bloom anoth effect dietari treatment is to restrict carbohydr intak dure the treatment phase thi is especi import if the gi system is involv if candida can not get glucos it s not go to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can us amino acid and fatti acid for energi a chanc to take over and keep the candida in check onc carbohydr is return to the gut if steve and some of the other nai sayer want to jump all over thi post fine i jump all over steve in sci med nutrit becaus he verbabl accost a poster who wa seek advic about her doctor s us of vitamin a and anti fungal for a candida bloom in her gut peopl seek advic from newsnet should not be treat thi wai those of us give of our time and knowledg can slug it out to our heart s content if you save your venom for me steve and left the helpless poster who ar timidli seek help alon i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior martin banschbach ph d
