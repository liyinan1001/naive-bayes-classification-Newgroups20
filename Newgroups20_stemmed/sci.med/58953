as follow the pressur point massag is an aggress physic massag that actual knead the tension out of muscl much like a profession shiatsu masseur the power motor drive two counter rotat thumb that move in on inch orbit releas tension in the neck back leg and arm pressur point massag a to order or receiv a catalog call hour dai or fax at note when i order the massag the item number wa differ and the price wa not when i receiv it i glanc thru the newer catalog enclos with it to see anyth wa differ from the first on i wa quit annoi to see a differ in price i call them about it and the cust rep said that thei had switch manufactur although it look and work exactli the same he told me to go ahead and return the first on and order the cheaper on us the price differ as a reason for return in fact sinc the newer on might take a while to ship from the factori i receiv thi on in dai he told me i could us the on i alreadi have until the new on arriv then return the old on veri reason peopl i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a build i would be describ as structur unsound i have stretch and exercis to do that help but the problem never realli goe awai if for whatev reason i do not exercis for a while ill not enough time lazi etc the muscl becom quit stiff and pain and thu more prone to further strain even with exercis i sometim requir physic therapi to get back on track which st requir a doctor visit to get the prescript for p t the tension in my neck if not releas eventu caus a headach sometim confus with a sinu headach over my left ey when my physic therapist ha massag my neck and the sub occipit muscl in particular the knobbi area near the base of the skull the headach usual eas within a dai although it hurt like hell to while it is be massag i order thi devic becaus it seem to be exactli what i wa wish someon would invent a machin that would massag not vibrat my neck and sub occipit muscl like my physic therapist ha done in the past that i could us by myself no doctor visit or inconveni p t appt for a week later would be need to us it i could get up in the middl of the night and us it if necessari i have been us it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a x rectangl about high with handl on each side and it plug into an averag outlet the two metal thumb ar about in diamet and protrud about abov the base the thumb ar cover with a grai cloth that is non remov thei ar locat more toward on end rather than center see figur below thei move in either clockwis or counter clockwis direct depend on which side of the switch is push and ar veri quiet it can be us from either side for instanc the thumb can be posit at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depend on which direct you approach it for the neck head the user vari the amount of pressur us by if lai down allow all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumb the handl can also be us if sit or stand appli pressur with the arm wrist sinc my wrist ar also impair i m type thi over an extend period of time and i don t have someon live with me who can appli it lai down work well for me for my back i sit in a high back kitchen chair posit the massag behind me at whatev point i want massag and lean back lightli or not so lightli against it the pressur of lean back hold it in place if i want to massag the entir spine i simpli move it down a few inch whenev i feel like it for my back thi machin is far superior to us than the commonli us home made massag of tenni ball tape togeth with the ball posit against a wall or door them over the spine and move the bodi up and down against them the tenni ball ar better than noth but difficult to us for veri long especi if your quad ar not in good shape and my long hair get painfulli in the wai if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concern the easier someth like thi is to us the more like i ll us do it if there ar multipl consider hassl i m more like to not bother with it not onli ha thi machin help with my headach but my rang of motion for my neck and back ar greatli increas the first time i us it on my neck sub occipit muscl howev i overdid it and press too hard against it which result in a veri tender almost bruis area for a few dai i laid off it for about dai and appli ic which help after that i wa more gradual about appli pressur at thi point the pain in the sub occipit area is now minim while be massag i also learn to us veri light pressur on my lower back which is the most vulner point for me it also eas some pain knot of tension between my shoulder blade although again it took a few dai of massag just a few minut at a time to realli work it out i highli recommend thi product if you have similar problem although i cannot vouch for it durabl it seem pretti sturdi sinc i ve had it such a short time i plan to us it not onli to eas tension but also to loosen the muscl befor exercis and mayb after too i have been ill recent and not abl to exercis much for a few week so thi wa veri time for me thi is the st product i ve order from thi compani and onli recent becam awar of it thru a co worker the catalog state thei have been in busi sinc it contain quit a few health care product and while thei appear to be more expens than the averag health care catalog product thei also appear to be of much higher qualiti with more thought put into what thei actual do definit a step abov some other on i ve seen such as dr leonard health care catalog or matur wisdom i m onli but have end up on some geriatr type mail list no big surpris here i consid mani of those product to be rip off particularli target toward the elderli with dubiou health benefit i apolog for the length of thi but it s the kind of info i would like to know befor order
