about kidnei stone not long after i got into sci med i got flame by a medic fellow for state that magnesium would prevent kidnei stone format i m go to state it again here but the best wai to prevent kidnei stone from form is to take b supplement read on to find out why i have my asbesto suit on now gui vitamin c will form oxal acid but larg dose ar need abov gram per dai review articl nutrit factor in calcium contain kidnei stone with particular emphasi on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycin also form oxal acid d amino acid oxidas for both glycin and vitamin c on of the best wai to drastic reduc thi product is not to cut back on dietari intak of vitamin c or glycin but to increas your intak of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with larg dose of pyridoxin in patient with kidnei stone int urol nephrol to mg of b each dai significasntli decreas the urinari excret of oxal over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxin in primari hyperoxaluria clin sci patient receiv at least mg b each dai show a signific reduct in urinari oxal level for gylcin thi effect is due to increas transaminas activ b is requir for transaminas activ which make less glycin avail for oxid deamin d amino acid oxidas for vitamin c the effect is quit differ there ar differ pathwai for vitamin c catabol the pathwai that lead to oxal acid format will usual have to of the ingest dose go into oxal acid but thi is highli variabl and the vitamin c review articl point out that unless the dose get upto gram per dai not too much vitamin c get catabol to form oxal acid at veri high dose of

dose gram jump it to mg over the averag excret befor supplement and gram jump it to mg over the averag befor supplement b is requir by more enzym than ani other vitamin in the bodi there ar probabl some enzym that requir vitamin b that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabol is still not complet understood but the specul is that thi other pathwai that doe not form oxal acid must have an enzym in it that requir b differ in b level could then explain the veri variabl product of oxal acid from a vitamin c challeng thi is not the prefer rout of catabol increas your intak of b would then result
