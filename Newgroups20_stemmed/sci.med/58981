subject re scienc and methodolog wa homeopathi tradit i think that part of the problem is that i have propos a definit of scienc that i intend to be interpret broadli and that lee ladi ha interpret fairli narrowli my definit is thi scienc is the investig of the empir that avoid mistak in reason and methodolog discov from previou work lee ladi write i don t think that scienc should be defin in a wai that some of the activ that lead to realli import scienc name think and inform explor ar not recogn as scientif work unless on classifi think and inform explor as a mistak thei fall under my definit i hope no on would consid specul think and inform explor as unscientif in articl c nasf mh new hawaii edu ladi uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lee ladi write serious i m not sure whether i misjudg you or not in on respect i still have a major problem though with your insist that scienc is mainli about avoid mistak here is where i think we ar talk at cross purpos it is not clear to me that the kind of definit i have propos should be taken as describ what scienc is mainli about consid for exampl a definit of invertebr as all anim lack a backbon thi fairli tell what is an invertebr and what is not an invertebr but it hardli tell you what invertebr ar all about on can read thi definit and still not know that of all anim speci ar invertebr that invertebr possess a remark broad rang of form that some invertebr group such as insect and nematod ar ubiquit in all ecosystem etc in short know the definit of invertebr doe not tell on what thei ar mainli about the misunderstand here is my fault i did not give suffici context for peopl to understand my propos definit okai so let s see if we agre on thi first of all there ar degre of certainti it might be appropri for instanc to demand carefulli control trial befor we accept as absolut scientif truth to the extent that there is ani such thing the effect of a certain treatment on the other hand highli favor clinic experi even if uncontrol can be adequ to justifi a preliminari judgement that a treatment is us secondli it make sens to be more toler in our standard of evid for a pronounc effect than for on that is margin i agre on both count as an exampl of the second it would onli take a few case of cure rabi to convinc most veterinarian that a treatment wa effect despit a lack of control as to the first i do not think it is us to talk about absolut scientif truth i think it is more us to talk about the kind of evid that variou claim have and the kind of evid in particular field that in the past have proven faulti or reliabl the latter is obvious a matter of degre and in each field practition try to discov the relev of differ kind of evid on of the primari mistak that mark the advocaci of an idea as psuedo scienc is that the advocaci lack ani sens of proport regard the kind of evid relat to the propos claim the kind of evid that ar actual relev to it and the histor reason in the field that certain kind of evid ar given more weight than other it is perfectli alright to specul i have read quit a few refere paper that specul left and right but the author were care to identifi the notion as specul to list what littl evid wa present avail for them and to describ how research could proce to either put the notion on more firm foot or to uncov it problem often what distinguish whether a paper of thi sort pass muster is the thought with which the author set the context and pave the wai for futur work it is in thi area that mani propon of specul idea fail the folk over in sci psycholog have a hundr and on excus not to make thi simpl test thei claim that onli an elabor outcom studi will be satisfactori a studi of the sort that nlp practition mani of whom make a bare margin live from their practic can ill afford to do most of them ar also just plain not interest becaus the whole idea seem frivol and sinc thei re not part of the scientif establish thei have no tangibl reward to gain from scientif accept i think a lot of scientist steer awai from thing that deserv or not garner a patina of kooki when propon of some practic see no valu in more care investig of that practic that set alarm ring in mani research mind thi is unfortun becaus there is undoubtedli some intersect between thing that ar worth investig and thing that ar advoc by those who seem careless or unreason in their advocaci on the other hand i can understand why mani scientist would just as soon select other direct for research as gordon bank ha point out no on want to becom thi gener s rhine on academ in sci psycholog said that it would be complet unscientif for him to test the phobia cure sinc it hasn t been describ in a scientif journal i think thi is absurd actual at least on fairli care academ studi ha been done with favor result but it s appar not accept becaus it s a doctor dissert and not publish in a refere journal i wonder why the result were not publish in my field dissert result ar typic summar in paper that ar submit to journal often the paper ar accept for public befor the dissert is finish thi certainli eas on s defens final i hope lee ladi will forgiv me from comment either on nlp or the discuss of it in sci psycholog i know littl about either and so have noth to offer russel
