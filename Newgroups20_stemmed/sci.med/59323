subject pm can it be prevent by a diet chang thi question came up in sci med nutrit and i m post my answer here onli medic school in the u s teach cours on human nutrit we have alreadi seen what a lack of nutrit educ can do when candida and kidnei stone present themselv to the medic commun i think that the best exampl of where u s medicin is realli miss the mark when it come to a knowledg of nutrit is pm so mani women and their husband suffer from thi disord that it is realli crimin that most physician in the u s ar not taught that pm is primarili caus by diet and diet chang can prevent it from ever happpen befor shoot your flame read the entir articl and then decid if flame is justifi from a poster in sci medi nutrit in a psycholog anthropolog cours i am take we got sidetrack onto a short convers about pm some rumor share by sever of the student includ idea that vitamin level sugar intak and caffein intak might affect pm symptom is there ani data on thi or is it just so much

primarili a disord that aris out of a hormon imbal that is dietari in natur but sinc observ studi ar consid by most physician in sci med to be anecdot in natur i have not bother to cite them there ar also over a half dozen good experiment studi that have been done on multivitamin and miner supplement to prevent pm i ve chosen the best specif studi on individu vitamin and miner to try to point out that pm is primarili a nutrit disord but doctor don t recogn nutrit disord unless thei can see clinic patholog beri beri pellagra scruvi etc pm is probabl the best reason why everi doctor be train in
