been an old persian form zara ushtra from which the greek form zoroastr mai be deriv and there mai have exist an old iranian form zarat ushtra to which mai be link the middl iranian zrdrwsht sever middl persian form such as zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainti onli that the second half of the name ushtra mean camel the form zoroast deriv from the greek zoroastr wa us tradition in european cultur until the eighteenth centuri when zarathustra closer to the origin and as found in nietzsch came into common us after the rediscoveri of the avesta the collect of sacr book of zoroastrian and the result studi in iranian philolog see avesta notwithstand the great and continu popular of zarathushtra even in western cultur the sourc avail to us ar few extrem fragment and heterogen our principl sourc ar the five gatha song attribut to zarathushtra himself and includ in the yasna section of the avesta gatha ahunava yasna gatha ushtava yasna gatha spentamainyu yasna gatha vokukhshathra yasna and gatha vashishtoishti yasna the last of which wa probabl written after the prophet s death other sourc of consider albeit vari import ar the younger avesta and the remain zoroastrian religi literatur in particular the pahlavi text of the ninth and tenth centur ce although the achaemenid inscript sixth to fourth centur bce never mention zarathushtra he is mention by some greek sourc of the time not howev by herodotu who seem unawar of him the avesta doe not provid ani direct or explicit data concern the true chronolog histori of zarathushtra but the text is us in an indirect wai as it clearli impli that the environ in which zoroastrian aros wa not that of iran under the mede or the persian the greek sourc on the other hand do provid some inform concern the time of zarathushtra although from a histor point of view thei ar unreli some place him six thousand year befor the trojan war xanthu of lydia eudoxu of cnidu hermippu hermodoru aristotl plutarch diogen laertiu and plini the account by xanthu of lydia howev ha also been interpret by some to mean six hundr rather than six thousand year befor the expedit of xerx against greec thi interpret is favor by diogen laertiu who make refer to xanthu but although a few scholar a s shabazi helmut humbach have recent attempt to rehabilit it under variou pretext it is gener reject although the histor valu of the greek sourc is neglig thei ar nonetheless import in that thei show that the millenarian doctrin of histori of the cosmo had alreadi been develop in iran by the achaemenid period as the abov account would seem to demonstr thei also show that by thi time zarathushtra wa alreadi seen as an almost mythic figur on from an extrem distant past all of thi lead to the conclus that the prophet could not have belong to a histor period contemporari with or even close to that of the achaemenid later zoroastrian sourc the pahlavi text do provid an absolut chrono logi for zarathushtra on that wa also accept by some arab author accord ing to these sourc zarathushtra live or year befor alexand again scholar ar divid on the valid of the chronolog some view it as histor reliabl while other believ that it is devoid of histor justif the most convinc argument howev seem to support the latter posit the figur of year is accur onli on the surfac becaus it repres in fact the more gener on of which wa emploi by sasanid propagandist to locat zarathushtra s lifetim roughli around the begin of iranian domin for a number of reason connect with complex problem inher in the iranian chronolog there wa also a desir on the part of the sasanid propagandist to avoid ani millenarian threat in thi context zarathushtra whom tradit place earli in the ninth millennium after the begin of the cosmo convert vishtaspa at the ag of forti two and vishtaspa s convers wa view by some as the begin of the millennium thu explain the doubl date of and year befor alexand given the unreli of the few avail sourc we ar forc to reconstruct an absolut chronolog on the basi of other element princip on the content that zarathushtra must have live a few centuri befor cyru the great cambys and dariu as there is no mention in the avesta of the great polit achiev that took place in western iran in the middl of the first millennium bce nor is there ani mention of the histori of that period which wa to lead iran to a posit of such predomin at the same time for a number of reason go back much further in histori would not be justifi consequ the tradition accept theori of place zara thushtra around the begin of the first millennium bce appear to be the most legitim as to zarathushtra s land of origin mani scholar agre on the basi of valid argument that he must have come from eastern iran some have held that he wa a mede larg becaus of a late iranian tradit link zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also becaus of linguist reason base on the languag of the avesta thi hypothesi howev should be discard as we can suppos both on histor and linguist ground that zarathushtra came from the east even though we do not know precis from which region there is a consider varieti of opinion on thi particular matter includ the improb view that he came from chorasmia or present dai khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reach as far as the oas of merv and herat most like howev zarathushtra s
