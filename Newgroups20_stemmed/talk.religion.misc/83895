subject re alt sex stori under literari critic analysi in articl qevbh h v agat berkelei edu dzkriz ocf berkelei edu denni kriz write hi all i m go to try to do someth here that perhap mani would not have thought even possibl i want to begin the process of initi a literari critic studi of the pornographi post on alt sex stori to identifi the major theme and motif present in the stori post there open up then the possibl of an object moral evalu of the materi present there first off let me congratul you for not post a flame about you sick pervert you ar immor you ar all go to hell which seem to be the usual religi post found on the alt sex hierarchi hopefulli you won t get flame either you will howev be argu with i person think that your project is built on unsteadi ground first i do not believ that there is ani wai to find an object moral moral and valu ar inher subject thei repres the belief of a person or a group of peopl thei can be wide held perhap even overwhelmingli held but thei ar never and can never be object assumpt a christian bedrock assumpt that all that is true come truli from god regard alt sex stori while perhap even from an object standpoint the major of it materi is inde repugn you come to thi conclus quit quickli when you start think about analyz it materi like thi some of it reflect some fairli profound need in peopl as well as some truth and deserv to be point out second i do not accept the assumpt that you make here if as you sai you ar try to be object then why accept a moral to begin with by us the christian bibl you re defeat your own purpos by do so in the long run the advantag of make such a literari moral analysi is that it will save band width between christian and non mutual flame each other about the moral accept of the stuff on these pornograph group third call me a pessimist but you won t stop the flamag there will alwai be peopl who pop upin alt sex to tell us how sick and twist and evil we all ar just out of curios do alt sex reader show up unprovok in the religion group to tell you all that you ar narrow mind censor overbear totalitarianist basic there should not be a disson between a christian moral and a non christian on either there is valu in a particular work or there is not whether on is a christian or not hm let me provid an exampl four peopl get togeth over dinner to discuss moral you me a rather conserv moslem and a sociopath i start off by sai that i think it s immor to forc peopl to have sex with you you agre but also sai that it is immor to have sex with someon of your own gender just a note i realli don t know your view on homosexu i am just us thi as a common view of moral for the purpos of thi exampl the moslem sai that it is immor for women to have their face uncov the sociopath who ha becom bore kill all three of us and eat us but feel no guilt becaus he ha done noth wrong moral in hi own mind in support for the first assumpt the christian scriptur sai thi evid delet i m not go to accept your evid for thi you ask us to accept the word of god that everyth good come from god thi is onli a valid argument for a person who share your belief still i must sai that catalog the major theme and motif in erotica could be interest for other reason than your so good luck with thi next part now then what ar some of the major theme motif in the pornograph literatur on place like alt sex stori these ar some that i ve been abl to identifi pleas add comment on them motif the male cinderella in so mani of the stori there is express a feel of alien and worthless on the part of the writer or otherwis protagonist of the stori with regard to the object the other person of hi her desir often a stori involv a protagonist who on the surfac is quit averag but underneath usual ha an enorm dick who desir to in some wai to gain access in a definit sexual wai to the other person who he she confess is far more desir than he she is and who inde seem to walk between the rain drop hmmm do i detect just a wee bit of condesc here motif a celebr of inde preoccup with beauti not veri object the vast major of pornograph literatur deal with beauti be it innoc somehow about to be lost grace or simpli physic beauti and gener most peopl christian or non will sai that beauti is good on could constru thi to mean that beauti peopl ar better or more good than non beauti peopl i would hope that peopl reliz that thi is not necessarili true motif on s dick is on s instrument of redempt might i suggest the word peni it seem more in line with the tone of your post bless ar those who ar well hung for thei shall get laid from what would thu be a revis matthew bravo i respect you and your sens of humor sir motif sex as an express of sincer give there is often enough a clear desir on the part of the protagonist to give definit sexual pleasur to the object person of hi her desir ye and thi theme is usual what the better stori ar about howev thei ar not alwai selfish i could point to exampl in the work of elf sternberg for exampl motif alt sex stori describ a sex which is complet remov from the realm of transmit life so remov is sex from it procr dimens on alt sex stori that on begin to wonder why sex even involv ejacul as in the context describ in pornographi it serv then no real purpos it serv the same purpos as it doe in pornograph movi it affirm the viril of the male involv as well as assur the reader that he the charact ha orgasm the whole pictur tm is probabl veri well describ by the cathol teach on thi of the husband and wife in an act of total mutual self give in the sexual union cooper with god in open themselv up for the transmiss of new life cf human vita your whole pictur tm unfortun onli appli to peopl who accept your church in addit if sex is for procreat then why did god make it pleasur so that peopl would want to do it rather than build it in as instinct why did god make it fallibl not everi sexual encount result in pregnanc even among cathol doe thi mean that thei have sin in ani case alt sex stori and the cathol teach will probabl not see ey to ey on thi for a long time grant motif sex us as an instrument violenc power and humili why pornographi seem to tend in that direct i realli do not know probabl volum could be written on the relationship between sex and power humili but thi probabl give good reason why tradition judeo christian ha been so neg with regard to sexual it seem to tend to a great moral morass pornographi would not tend in those direct if there were not a demand for it mani peopl have violent fantasi that thei would never act out in real life but will think about and read about and mull over later jeff jeffj yang earlham edu offici gener sig under line under column no amiga check no witti quot no map
