friedenb mapl egr msu edu write as a latter dai saint i found john s statement not at all ludicr pleas allow me to explain myself in the governor of missouri governor bogg issu hi so call mormon extermin order the onli crime illeg activ the latter dai saint had commit wa their religi affili their anti slave stanc missouri still allow slave practic and their grow number influenc in missouri i guess the mormon got what thei deserv becaus thei refus to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular author thi disobedi brought upon them persecut murder and final forc expuls from their land and settlement it is signific to rememb that these secular posit were held by averag peopl and that at the time almost all american were pretti homogeon christian it wa larg the mainstream christian s disgust at such practic as polygami which result in their irrat hatr true but that is exactli the problem the mormon extermin order wa issu not just by a christian it wa allow under the constitut of the unit state which wa institut precis to prevent incid like thi order from occur in the first place as i indic in an earlier post your irrat hatr is clearli evidenc by individu like robert weiss who could have been gov bogg lieuten he would have fit right in drewl et al and seem a modern dai occurr base on result slander persecut misrepresent li deni mormon represent in their own user group etc etc in intent and purpos what realli ha chang the situat is not entir differ todai mani irrat feel and belief ar justifi through religion i don t think most of them ar start becaus of religion but religion certainli help justifi and perpetu prejudic and practic by provid a neat justif which discourag critic thought true as evidenc by numer exampl as i am sure you re awar in ani regard mormon histori alon indic that secular author and i don t even discuss how uthan s were sucker into allow part of their land in becom nerv ga and atom bomb test ground is far from be trust or righteou have thing realli chang for the better i mai be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoev that such ha been the case in the earli s i believ the late presid kimbal ld church leader strongli protest feder attempt to locat the mx peac keeper missil maze from be built in utah yet anoth inspir decis from secular author fortun hi opposit wa influenti enough for the fed to back off do you mean that the secular author ar some continu group of peopl with the common and uninterrupt goal of harrass erad the mormon do you honestli believ that the main reason for us utah for nuclear test etc wa to get them thar mormon and what about the major of uthan s who aren t mormon you seem to be search for enemi correct the major of utahn s ar mormon i believ up to a in mani citi and settlement throughout the western state conspiraci it is paranoid to believ that everyth that affect you badli must have been done primarili for that purpos what i mean is that secular author ar to be watch as we believ that satan ha been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justic in addit we believ that the adversari ha power to influenc the unjust and idolatr greed for monei would be a good exampl in order to bring about persecut war oppress and evil combin as an intellig be don t you suppos that the destroy would yield hi influenc foremost on those with polit power as far as utah is concern what i point out were some horribl exampl of environment nightmar impos upon by secular author which have brought death diseas i e the downwind and environment contami nation i am hardli paranoid i am just not expect too much from a secular govern that mai not share our valu and faith and which inde as gov bogg et al mai be out to harm and destroi us as a matter of fact propheci in my church indic that in futur year global persecut against mormon will so increas in intens and scope that paraphras all those who wish to escap persecut and murder must flee to zion zion the pure in heart will be re establish in those dai and it ain t our current secular author who will rule over it david koresh did not pose a great threat to the feder author or the secur of thi nation and with john i too wonder who or what s next i person feel that we should try to stop anyon who is a threat to the life of even on person sure he did not pose a threat to the secur of thi nation but he did pose a threat to the live of hi follow that much is definit hmmm definit by whom until such ha been establish beyond reason abl doubt thi alleg threat mai have been less than the threat impos upon him and hi follow by the batf and fbi who kill who what constitut right did the atf offic have to invad upon privat land and to forc themselv into the compound what realli caus the murder of the littl children could it be that the atf fbi presenc ha ani bear upon the event how would you interpret the mt masada event blame the jew what the heck did the roman do there anywai what busi did the atf fbi ha in waco texa the branch davidian never pose ani threat to societi thi is like ask who realli caus the death of the isra olymp team in in that case the polic botch the job as well but to lai a heavier burden on them than the terrorist would be a terribl mistak i think the same sort of reason appli in thi case certainli if david koresh chose ani peac option the atf and fbi would have compli the respons is more hi than the author come now at issu is in how much the author escal an otherwis peac stand off let s get it over with and forc david koresh to come out by gass them were thei naiv or what thei plai right into the hand of an apocalypt think individu he had prepar hi peopl for thi eventu for year and not on firetruck or plan wa in place to deal with thi scenario i feel that the author had some respons to protect their own citizen even if thei were religi zealot and guilti of not pai a gun licens ha the batf becom an extens of the local tax collector david koresh no doubt will be describ as the evil gui by the execution while the action of all those valiant and brave offic character the atf fbi as execution is inaccur and unfair in order to be an execution the least on must have done is have the intent to kill que intrus into privat properti with semi s load with life ammunit isn t that implicit intent or at least prepar to kill i ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justic i do not mind if crimin such as danger drug lord ar brought to justic but escal event to the point of allow to if not compli citi with the destruct of a peopl isaac kuo isaackuo math berkelei edu how lucki you english ar to find the toilet so amus o for us it is a mundan and function item for you the basi of an entir cultur manfr von
