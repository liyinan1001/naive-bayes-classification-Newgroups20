subject object wa after year thi discuss on object seem to be fall into solips eg the recent challeng from frank dwyer for someon to prove that he can actual observ phenomena someon even made the statement that scienc is subject and that even atom ar subject thi is get a bit silli and the word object is lose all mean let start by rememb the definit of object which ha been alreadi present object adj of or have to do with a materi object as distinguish from a mental concept have actual exist a unenfluenc by emot or person prejudic b base on observ phenomenon the object of a thing is not base on whether everyon agre on that thing eg the world is object round regardless of the fact that there exist flat earther but rather whether it is base observ and verifi phenomenon instead of be base sole on peopl wish feel mental process etc thu atom be base on veri observ and repeat phenomenon ar inde consid to be object rather than subject even weird high energi physic is base on observ phenomenon even though that observ can chang the outcom nor ar those observ phenomenon affect by emot or person prejudic eg chemic reaction do not chang to the whim of differ peopl thu to sai that scienc is not object ie object verifi is a bit silli as that is the point of scienc now i will agre that scienc is not object good i will not therebi conclud though that scienc is not object now some exampl thing which ar object a d tractor is larger than the averag breadbox chlorophyl is green seawat contain salt there exist ozon in the atmospher at least present ozon block ultraviolet light ultraviolet light increas the incid of skin cancer good on the other hand is a valu judgement it doesn t seem to have an exist apart from what we give it unless someon can object show the exist of an omnipot entiti which ha defin good we cannot quantifi it touch it or collect it in ani concret sens eg i have a bag full of good now we do sometim attempt to give the word good an object mean e g good ha been us to denot strength resili speed etc that though is a subject definit as some might not see strength and etc as necessarili good eg strength inspir by naziism is not gener view as good as to a moral i cannot sai that i have ever seen a moral strictli base on verifi observ phenomenon the closest i have seen is some form of the golden rule which conclud that it is best not to deliber piss peopl off as thei will like then involv themselv in your life in a manner you won t like thi is verifi when you get in someon s face thei will often retali anoth object fact about moral is that a more power group can enforc their moral on a weaker group and thu can at time ignor that form of the golden rule without fear of repris now as to whether thi enforc of moral is good or bad is quit subject by the wai rememb that subject doe not mean that a thing cannot be formal state or even commonli agre upon it onli mean that that it is not verifi from observ phenomena or ha a physic exist unto itself also note that i have not state that there is no such thing as an object moral or that i could not accept ani such a moral i have simpli state that i have seen no evid of ani such moral on other thing to notic object is mani time us as synonym with true and or absolut and subject sometim ha the connot of fals and or rel tain t necessarili so for instanc when a conclus is base on object but insuffici evid then it can be both object and fals as to absolut it is easi to note that while we can object show that tnt is explos but that doe not absolut mean that all tnt will explod and thu object is not necessarili absolut either on the other hand someth subject can also be either absolutist or true for instanc there ar some theist who ar specif absolutist in their moral even though thei have onli subject evid to back it up further mani a scientist and detect ha been motiv by subject reason eg a gut feel or hunch to investig a phenomena or situat and gather the object evid necessari to support a true hypothesi on the whole though i would have to agre that object evid is much more trustworthi than subject evid later dave butler in start ani thesi it seem to me on should put forward as on s point of departur someth incontrovert the express should be simpl and dignifi diogen
