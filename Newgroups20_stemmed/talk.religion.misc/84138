subject re christian abov the law wa clarif of pe in articl apr ualr edu nunnal ac hard edu john nunnal write when ar we go to hear a christian answer to thi question in paraphras on what or whose author do christian proclaim that thei ar abov the law and abov the prophet major and minor and not account to the ten command of which jesu clearli spoke hi opinion in matthew what is the sourc of thi pseudo doctrin who is the pseudo teacher who is the great deceiv ok here s at least on christian s answer jesu wa a jew not a christian in thi context matthew make sens matt do not think that i jesu came to abolish the law or the prophet i did not come to abolish but to fulfil jesu live under the jewish law howev he wa the culmin of the promis of the prophet he came to fulfil the propheci and fulli obei god s purpos vers sai for truli i sai to you until heaven and earth pass awai not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass awai from the law until all is accomplish the kei to thi vers imho is the last phrase jesu as the fulfil of the law accomplish what the law wa suppos to accomplish jesu did not sai that he wa the fulfil of the law and unless i m mistaken heaven and earth have not yet pass awai am i mistaken and even assum that on can just gloss over that portion of the word of jesu do you realli think that all is accomplish vers whoever then annul on of the least of these command and so teach other shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keep and teach them he shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven taken in the context of jesu teach jewish peopl about live live under the law thi make sens then why didn t jesu sai ani jew who annul in v ar you sai that all of jesu record word mean noth to gentil ar you realli sai that jesu onli spoke for and to the jew jesu didn t mention your name doe that mean he wasn t speak to you when you read the word of jesu do you think he is speak to someon other than you in gener it appear that jesu is respond to some critic he must have receiv about do awai with the law that wa not jesu intent at all you said abov that jesu wa the fulfil of the law ar you sai that doe not mean do awai with the law he had come to earth to live the law as it should be live and fulfil the promis made by god to hi peopl all the wai back to ev gen the serpent will bruis your heel but he will bruis hi head gen jp i will put enmiti between you and the woman and between your offspr and her thei shall strike at your head and you shall strike at their heel gen nrsv i will put enmiti between you and the woman and between your offspr and her he will strike your head and you will strike hi heel gen kjv and i will put enmiti between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruis thy head and thou shalt bruis hi heel look like your translat ha taken a few liberti with the word jesu appear to be do awai with the law becaus he did not honor the tradit of men as equal to the law of god he regularli lock horn with the religi leader of the dai becaus he would not conform to their rule onli god s law in the matthew passag jesu is defend hi dedic to the law and defend himself against hi accusor almost the entir sermon on the mount matt is dedic to help the jewish peopl understand the true intent of the law sweep awai the clutter which had been introduc by the pharase and their tradit onli help the jewish peopl in galatian paul describ the relationship of jesu to the law in thi wai but befor faith came we were kept in custodi under the law be shut up to the faith which wa later to be reveal therefor the law ha becom our tutor to lead us to christ that we mai be justifi by faith but now that faith ha come we ar no longer under a tutor for you ar all son of god through faith in christ jesu i believ thi sai that after christ wa reveal the law had serv it s purpos i e our tutor to lead us to christ and now we ar no longer under a tutor the law ha been fulfil as christ said he would do you ar us your interpret of paul as an argument against the clear word of jesu god the author of the old law and the christ man jesu ar the same person therefor the old law and the new testament the last will and testament of jesu ar base on the same moral principl it make sens that mani of the principl in the old law ar re express in christian re express care to defin that a bit better on the other hand now that the law ha fulfil it s purpos and what ar heaven and earth gone awai where did thei go is all accomplish for exampl revel explain pleas christian relat to god through christ not the law it also make sens that new practic and new symbol were establish to repres the mysteri of thi new relationship i e baptism repres christ s death burial and resurrect rom the lord s supper as a memori to hi sacrific i cor and sundai as a dai of worship commemor hi resurrect matt ff act again your interpret of paul versu the clear word of jesu do you see ani problem here when did heaven and earth go awai when wa all accomplish ok that s on christian s explan i don t claim to have all these issu complet settl even in my own mind and i welcom other christian to offer other altern pleas excus the long post thank for your interest if you have read thi far
