the zoroastrian doctrin of the savior of the futur saoshyant wa the basi for the stori of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew the old persian word magu render in greek by mago is of uncertain etymolog it mai origin have meant member of the tribe as in the avestan compound mogu tbish hostil to a member of the tribe thi mean would have been further restict among the mede to member of the priestli tribe and perhap to priest benvenist boyc the term is probabl of median origin given that herodotu mention the magoi as on of the six tribe of the mede for a varieti of reason we can consid the magi to have been member of a priestli tribe of median origin in western iran among the persian thei were respons for liturg function as well as for maintain their knowledg of the holi and the occult most like the supremaci of the median priesthood in western iran becam establish dure the time of the median monarchi that domin the persian from the end of the eighth centuri through the first half of the sixth centuri bce until the revolt of cyru the great bce the persian were indebt to the mede for their polit and civil institut as well even if hypothes have been advanc concern the exist of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyc we must still maintain that thei were of median origin thi is demonstr by the eposid of the revolt of gaumata the magian mention by dariu i bce in the inscript at bisutun iran as well as by greek sourc inde herodotu insist on the idea of the usurpatori power of the mede against the persian through the conspiraci of the magi the fact that the magi mai have been member of a tribe that hand down the sacerdot art in a hereditari fashion natur did not exclud the possibl that some of them undertook secular prefess thi seem to be attest by the elamit tablet at persepoli there is a these put forth by giusepp messina that deni that the magi ar member of an ethnic group by suggest that thei ar simpli member of the priesthood a priesthood of pure zoroastrian origin thi thesi is unten on the other hand the hypothesi that their name is relat to the avestan term magavan deriv from the gathic maga vedic magha gift is not without foundat mole the mean of maga can probabl be found in conform with the pahlavi tradit within the context of the concept of puriti or separ of the mixtur of the two oppos principl of spirit and matter the maga which ha been erron interpret as choru from the root mangh which is said to mean sing the magic song nyberg and ha been render simpli by an express like unio mystica seem to be an ecstat condit that open the mind to spiritu vision in ani case though there mai be a relat between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinct between the magi and the avestan priesthood the avesta ignor the median or old persian term despit a recent hypothesi propos by h w bailei old persian inscript ignor the avestan term for priest athravan vedic athravan even if thi is perhap present in an achaeminid set in the elamit tablet of persepoli gershevitch the term magu ha been present in zoroastrian throughout it histori the pahlavi term mogh mard and mobad repres it continu the latter in particular deriv from an older form magupati head of the magi dure the sasanid period third to seventh centuri ce which saw the format of a hierarch organ church the titl mobadan mobad the high priest of high priest came to be us to design the summit of the ecclesiast hierarchi the magi practic consanguin marriag or khvaetvadatha av pahl khwedodah thei also perform a characterist funer rite the exposur of the corps to anim and vultur to remov the flesh and therebi cleans it the corps wa not suppos to decompos lest it be contamin by the demon of putrefact thi practic later becam typic of the entir zoroastrian commun and led to the rise of a complex funer ritual in iran and among the parsi in india stone tower known as dakhma were built especi for thi rite dure the time of herodotu the practic of exposur of the corps wa in vogu onli among the magi the persian gener sprinkl the corps with wax then buri it the practic wa widespread howev among the peopl of central asia the magi were the technician of and expert on worship it wa imposs to offer sacrific without the presenc of a magu dure the perform of a ritual sacrific the magu sang of the theogoni the magi were possibl the custodian of a tradit of sacr poetri but we know noth about the relationship of thi tradit to the variou part of the avesta and wa call upon to interpret dream and to divin the futur the magi were also known for the practic of kill harm or ahriman anim khrafstra such as snake and ant thei dress in the median style wear pant tunic and coat with sleev thei wore a characterist head cover of felt gr tiara with strip on the side that could be us to cover the nose and mouth dure ritual to avoid contamin consecr object with their breath boyc the color of these cap in conform with a tradit that is probabl of indo european origin accord to georg dumezil wa that of the priesthood white in all likelihood dure the achaemenid period the magi were not in possess of a well defin bodi of doctrin and it is probabl that thei gradual adopt zoroastrian thei were most like a clergi consist of profession priest who were not ti to a rigid orthodoxi but were natur inclin to eclectic and syncret nonetheless thei must have been jealou guardian of the patrimoni of zorastrian tradit by virtu of thi thei were the educ of the royal princ the wisest of them wa respons for teach the princ the magic of zarathushtra son of horomaz and thu the cult of the god magi who excel in other virtu were entrust with the educ of the princ so that he would learn to be just courag and master of himself dure the achaemenid period the magi maintain a posit of great influenc although thei were certainli subordin to the emperor despit sever dramat event such as the massacr thei suffer after the death of gaumata the magian in which accord to herodotu who call himself smerdi the persian kill a larg number of magi to aveng the usurp the magi nevertheless manag to maintain their influenc at court in media in persia and in the variou region of the empir where thei were station as a consequ of the persian civilian and militari administr no priesthood of antiqu wa more famou than that of the magi thei were renown as follow of zarathushtra zoroast as the teacher of some of the greatest greek thinker pythagora democritu plato as the wise men who arriv guid by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem and as the propag of a cult of the sun in india but thei were also known as the chaldean the priesthood of babylon known for it occult thi wa perhap the reason that the term mago had a pejor sens in greek like goe expert in the magic art bidez and cumont inde the chaldean were expert in all type of magic art especi astrolog and had a reput for wisdom as well as knowledg to understand the reason for such variou and sometim discord view it is necessari to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so call western magi who were later hellen in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor syria mesopotamia and armenia who came in contact with divers religi tradit must have sooner or later and in vari degre been influenc by syncret concept the greek were familiar with both kind of magi and depend on their vari concern would emphas on or the other aspect of them classic historian and geograph includ herodotu and strabo document their custom while the philosoph dwell abov all on their doctrin dualism belief in the hereaft magian cosmolog and cosmogoni and their theologi and eschatolog those sourc most interest in the doctrin of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magu in do so thei ar repeat what the magi themselv said from the median and achaemenid period when thei adopt zoroastrian at that time thei embrac zarathushtra as on of their own and place themselv under hi vener name zoroastrian had alreadi undergon sever profound transform in the eastern commun by the time of the acheamenid and wa alreadi adapt those element of the archaic religion that refus to die it ha been said quit often in an attempt to character the precis role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradit that the vendidad from vi daevo data the law abjur daiva part of the avesta should be attribut to them thi collect of text from variou period is primarili concern with purificatori rule and practic nonetheless the hypothesi is hardli plausibl sinc the first chapter of the vendidad a list of sixteen land creat by ahura mazda the suprem god of zoroastrian but contamin by an attack by ahriman pahl gathic avestan angra mainyu the other suprem god and the ultim sourc of all evil and suffer doe not mention western iran persia or media the land of ragha mention in the text cannot be median raghiana furthermor it ha been note gershevitch that if the author had been magi the absenc of ani refer to western iranian institut includ their own priesthood would be veri strang the magi were abov all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradit and the corpu of the avesta have been transmit to us from the second half of the first millennium bce on thi ha been their princip merit we can attribut directli to the magi the new formul that iranian dualism assum known to us especi from greek sourc and in part from the pahlavi literatur of the ninth and tenth centuri ce accord to thi formul the two pole of the dualism ar no longer as in the gatha spenta mainyu benefic spirit and angra mainyu hostil spirit but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch see ahura mazda and angra mainyu thi tran format wa of immens consequ for the histor develop of zoro astrian and wa most like determin by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religi world in thi new dualism which wa that later known to the greek aristotl eudemu of rhode theopompu and other we can see the affirm of a new current of thought within zoroastrian to which we give the name zurvan see zurvan thank to their adher to zoroastrian the magi plai an enorm import role in the transmiss of zarathushtra s treach as well as in the definit of the new form that these would assum histor their natur propens to eclectic and syncret also help the diffus of zoroastrian idea in the commun of the iranian diaspora the greek began to studi their doctrin and to take an interest in them xanthu of lydia hermodoru aristotl theopompu hermippu dinon even write treatis on the persian religion of which onli the titl and a few fragment have surviv in the hellenist period the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom and write on magic astrolog and alchemi were lent the author of such prestigi name as zarathushtra ostan and hystasp form an abund apocryph literatur bidez and cumont later still eschatolog and apocalypt were a fertil meet ground for iranian and judeo christian religion as can be seen in the famou oracl of hystasp a work whose iranian root ar undeni and which most like date from the begin of the christian era probabl the second centuri ce widengren the zoroastrian doctrin of the savior of the futur saoshyant wa the basi for the stori of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew see saoshyant the sasanid period saw the magi onc again plai a determin role in the religi histori of iran concern to win back the western magi de menasc and eager to consolid zoroastrian as the nation religion of iran the priest of iranian sanctuari in media and persia were abl to establish a true state church strongli hierarch and endow with an orthodoxi base on the format of a canon of scriptur the lead figur in the develop of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxi were tosar and kerder the persecutor of mani in the third centuri saoshyant the avestan term saoshyant futur benefactor mper soshan design the savior of the world who will arriv at a futur time to redeem humankind the concept of the futur savior is on of the fundament notion of zoro astrian togeth with that of dualism it appear as earli as in the gatha zarathushtra zoroast as the prophet of the religion is himself a sao shyant on who perform hi work for the frashokereti the end of the present state of the world when exist will be rehabilit and made splendid see frashokereti later zoroastrian doctrin develop thi notion into a true eschatolog myth and expand the number of saoshyant from on to three all the savior ar born from the seed of zarathushtra which is preserv through the ag in lake kansaoya identifi with present dai lake helmand in seistan iran protect by fravashi or guardian spirit the greatest of the await saoshyant the victori astvatereta he who embodi truth the son of the

and of asha astvatereta will look upon the whole of corpor exist and render it imperish he and hi comrad will engag in a great battl with the forc of evil which will be destroi the name astvatereta is clearli the result of theolog specul kellen as ar those of hi two brother ukhshyatereta he who make truth grow and ukhshyatnemah he who make rever grow the name of the three virgin yasht who ar

a new cycl of exist astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind the doctrin of the futur savior had alreadi taken shape in the archaemenid period sixth to fourth centuri bce it wa not perhap the princip element in the format of the messian idea but it wa certainli a determin factor on that enjoi great success in the hellenist period beyond the confin of the iranian world a similar concept that of the futur buddha maitreya wa most like indebt to it and christian messian can trace it root to the same sourc
