ve never had thi huge guilt feel hang over my shoulder good it show that you have a strong self imag that you love yourself that is the second greatest command jesu taught if onli more peopl could do as you do as i said befor in the common english venacular feel guilti ha a differ mean than the state of guilt thi all is a veri clear indic that you need a certain person type in order to believ and adjust to certain religi doctrin and if your person type is opposit then you ar not that easili attach to a certain world view system i believ what we all need in our person is a lot less ego a lot less self centered and a lot more uncondit love there ar human that subscrib to the same notion the nice thing is that when you final shake off thi huge burden the shoulder feel far more relax ye you have state what jesu said rememb come to me take my yoke upon your shoulder for my burden is light a yoke is us to direct oxen to do work onc you have a relationship with jesu you and him share the yoke and the burden of life have god at your side is of great advantag
