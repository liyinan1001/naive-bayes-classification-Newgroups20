subject re christian meta ethic in lsjc cinnmc saltillo cs utexa edu turpin cs utexa edu russel turpin write in articl c f gf panix com ml panix com michael siemon write the issu then is thi christian a sai behavior such and such is sin what is christian b suppos to do with such a statement on possibl alwai exist a mai be abl to persuad b that the behavior in question doe exhibit a failur in love god or neighbor michael modern liber that he is read a fairli benign mean into thi word he then construct hi religi belief around thi understand read other scriptur in the context of these command with love benignli understood i regard love as no more or less benign than ani other christian doe you ar mere express approv of the consequ i find therein which sai more about our polit and cultur trap than about my or ani religion love is a highli ambigu word of which christian can write both the gentl word paul us of it in corinthian in a passag that even the conserv will quot at you and the word of t s eliot in hi pentacost hymn love is the unfamiliar name that wove the intoler shirt of flame thi is in ani case rather to the side of what i wa attempt to rais in my note as will becom more evid below as a non believ i find michael s christian kinder and gentler blechhh i think you ar misread me rather serious though given my principl that on cannot forc on s own notion of sin on anoth and my unshak disestablishmentarian russel turpin and other believ and unbeliev alik ar under no threat of my legisl my own understand of christian love if i take him at hi word he cannot condemn the inquisitor becaus thei were also follow these command as thei understood them if you misread i can do and have repeatedli done a complet bill of accus against the inquisit by exhibit in as thorough a form as anyon might want a demonstr of the harm it ha done to human be in the first place and to respect for let alon love of god in near success pleas go back to my quot word abov the possibl that alwai exist is that i or to revert to proper time sequenc my predecessor over the last sever centuri could persuad christian b of my case that the inquisit doe inde constitut an egregi violat of the law of love i must also note that the major of christian have been so persuad by christian argument as well as by secular both christian and non christian prohibit what mr turpin allud to is a trickier point a i demonstr the human pain and violat of love involv in the inquisit b the inquisitor respond that mother church must howev pain thi seem disciplin her children for their own good in thi case the salvat of their soul or if the tortur heret will not recant than by bad exampl deter other from the same loss of soul a i point out that thi justif of a failur in love depend on a highli specul construal of text and of philosoph assert that ar quit undemonstr b burn me at the stake my rhetor ha fail but the point i am make is sustain what is go on here ha a lot to do with cultur baggag in thi case the baggag includ a nearli univers and absolut secular belief that an accus person must prove innoc and that testimoni is most believ if taken under tortur the elimin of inqisitori practic in those place where it ha been elimin or at least greatli reduc ha veri littl if anyth to do with the discuss of sin in the exchang between a and b mr turpin is point out that if i am a versu the grand inquisitor s b then my persuas is not veri like to work i know thi and in what ever person agoni i consign the issu to god and my ghostli defens attornei so on possibl fail in thi case as it will fail in mai other at the other extrem the persuas will succe when it properli should not if it entail mistaken assumpt i share with the inquisitor and that is potenti an even more troubl case in that mani of the victim of inquisit will have accept that thei were in fact sin in such random case as thei mai actual have been guilti of charg brought against them the point is that the persuas break down when the parti do not share enough to agre on all the cultur baggag and given the main thrust of the inquisit against heresi it is bound to break down in precis the worst case the conserv i don t think that is the right word btw will take refug in what i attribut to b abov that he is justifi in caus harm becaus he think that work to a greater good but thi is a violent and extravag refus to follow the gospel as if on s theori about sin entitl on to cast asid jesu word on deal with sinner cf matthew ff i am a radic christian onli in that i take the gospel serious or for that matter what doe it mean to love on s fellow man and what is the right thing and how doe on go about love god well the whole point of make these the base command is that thei aren t reduc to rule a set of rule is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be veri help to individu or societi but not if thei ar us instead of a person involv in and respons for on s action the great command is more than anyth els a call to act as if you were god and accept ultim respons in your everi action a demand that i like most would rather not hear but it keep pop up nonetheless along with the reassur that it is more import that i be open to try thi than succeed at it conserv mai twist thi act as if you were god to mean lai down rule for other peopl and be as nasti to them as possibl if thei don t keep your rule thei ar so insist and obviou about thi that thei have convinc a lot of peopl who rightli reject the whole concept that such idioci is how god act that after all is the standard accus against god by the atheist here and elsewher that the conserv have confus their manipul hoop jump notion of coerc other peopl with the natur of god is almost the entir content of standard american atheism and i quit agre with it on thi point ethic system ar not differenti by the nice sound goo up front much of which sound pretti much the same but by the specif act procedur and argument that thei recommend and differ bodi of christian have from the begin urg differ ethic system or in some case none as a result it is bizarr to identifi ani on of these system howev popular or infam with christian christian doe not have a torah it doe not have a qu ran specif christian scriptur ha veri littl if anyth in the wai of command so littl that the christian who desper want command go mine for them with almost no support and thu almost no obviou limit for their effort the on singl thing in the gospel which jesu specif give as a command to us is love on anoth i will be expand on thi point in a repli to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a dai or so it is quit true that some christian infer lot of command from the nt i ll point out what ha to be go on in these infer and why there is a huge amount of cultur baggag involv you ar quit right that thi is goo if on is look for an ethic system but why should anyon be look for an ethic system sinc our societi is eager to hand us on or more no matter what we do it mai be that we need a principl for the critiqu of ethic system in which case i will profer the agap allel onc again i am glad that a few christian such as michael find a benign mean for the goo and then interpret the usual ugli specif in a more construct fashion on the other hand i do think that thi tell us more about michael and christian like him that it tell us about christian i think you ar beg the question why don t i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you someth about christian nor is thi veri new in christian you might want to look up the origin and fundament doctrin of the quaker from the th centuri onward and thei ar not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congeni to my case michael l siemon i sai you ar god son of the ml panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall ml ulyss att com like ani princ psalm
