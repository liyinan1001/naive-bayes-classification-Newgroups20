subject re that kill by sword must be kill by sword in articl apr utarlg uta edu b zaw utarlg uta edu stephen write in articl sandvik sandvik kent appl com sandvik newton appl com kent sandvik write so ar you happi now when peopl includ innoc kid di todai it s amaz how everyon automat blame on side or the other on thing for sure koresh will have no chanc to defend himself against the statement lack in fact or court sponsor verif made by agent who particip in the situat that kill him i don t know thei murder him i also don t know that the branch davidian set a fire and suicided it is sick of batf or fbi spokepeopl to make such comment in advanc of forens patholog stephen thank you god speed no kinda numb i thought someth like thi wa go to happen over a week ago on of the thing that s been obviou from the yah start is that when there ar two arm camp neither of which yield it s usual get slaughter when ani littl spark set it off which is why koresh and compani shouldn t have stockpil weapon and why the batf shouldn t have come prime for a raid bingo am i the onli on to notic a no peac attempt to serv a warrant b six month to develop a scene and six dai to end it c ah god children at least adult plu at the begin and more batf agent all dead pain point if the davidian fire first why were the batf on the roof rather than take cover ha anyon ask themselv these question have you seen the entir video sequenc taken dure the open round i seem to recal miss sever kei part a the first five minut of dai on onli the shoot part come out b what happen to the fed video unit you mean thei do not carri helmet cam wonder why not how is it you can have camera crew with live transmiss video present and not have an uninterrupt record a you realiz the unit carri ittl bitti mm backup that hold minut per unit and there ar twounit on the profession handheld so no tape turnov gap b until all view ar seen it is prematur to point finger in either direct as you well point out stephen anyon batf bd x bd other could have touch it off by mistak or malici more on thi below onc koresh wa shot disregard hi be a religi leader and apocalypt obsess most like the peopl insid just went on drill just like the batf outsid is the lesson that automat respons ar veri hazard last resort measur ye but it is so hard toremain human under the full pressur of hazard game plai and life pain point either side could have back off to help defus the situat we see the problem constantli here on the net with flame ego problem nuff said more to the point when someon di almost like it wa intend that wai both side will kill to maintain their innoc a contradict in term pain point it doesn t help to take side in such a situat just add fuel to the fire better is to let it burn out on it s own true usual i pick the unpopular side and point out from the evid seen what might have altern happen best exampl i can think of is christ with the tax coin he didn t have on and so didn t sanction the roman author unduli when thei show it to him he note that it wa caesar s mint and so said give it to him no wast of time and then he got back to more worthwhil concern god s will thi requir someon interest in god s will pleas note that the outstand overt problem in thi countri todai is on where the govern want caesar s coin to pai off the debt the anti tax movement of todai and the anti ssan as i d group would do well to note who the issu author is ditto for those ye the american peopl not the feder govern and if it is not spent toward that end no on deserv the coin made in the imag of god yah fewpeopl hear the contradict monei made in the imag of god no need to stir thing up in ever larger revo revo revolut as govern turn over and over and over i wish you were wrong mani pundit ar sai year the onyl good thing to come out of my divorc and my exposur to the damn pardon me american divorc attornei is i have no monei left to lose to tax or inflat pain point for mani thi wa just entertain thumb up thumb down just anoth thriller like termin or a good old ball game is the lesson that we ve becom jade to media realiti children dead if anyon think blame koresh or the batf help thi ani at all is sick and wrong the reason you can tell that the batf mai not be entir straight on thi is that the leader at press confer havew made ani comment about even the possibl that koresh or hi follow caus thi the batf agentss ar more concern with their repuat and moral not my fault koresh did it than thei ar with dead children same goe for koresh hi follow who ar all mostli dead pain point la burn the davidian burn in on case societi ha abandon the peopl which ha return to a frontier in the other the outskirt were bump against the suburb is the lesson that what s law in differ area of societi depend more on condit than law more on power and favorit my person opinion look to histori whenev privileg ha replac whatev token of object law and justic a societi ha had hitlerr have follow if we don t learn the lesson or at least make an honest effort the next conflagr will no doubt be closer to home rather than put out fire aren t there much more import concern for us to work on you do your name sake proud stephen it hard but pleas keep on keep on each voic in the wilder now will save a gener unborn from horror kent who can t cheer todai exactli what keep me from be a bomb thrower is my love god as irra tional as that is for so mani on direct benefit is be abl to keep thing in perspect ks the dai i need a gun or abomb to protect myself in thi societi is the dai that societi is alreadi beyond redempt and that aint redund if you have ani christian belief aytal and the dai that i cannot peacefulli enjoin other in the act that thoreau call civil disobedi to rectifi the wrong that my societi practis without undu harm or punish befal me is the dai that societi ha ceas to be a human societi and becom a societi of anim we ar veri cclose to that such as who hurt more the on who di or the love on who ar left besid the lesson it s also time for mani to griev includ those who ve lost their faith in other or in god i m learn to be patient and let thing heal god will six year fight an unjust court issu still struggl to be patient for those who like contrari question nb i wa not there i am not a branch davidian nor a law offici hater i do hate liar or the six letter varieti of same the offici side ha it advoc alreadi let balanc the equat and asj a few question on the other side for the sake of an old saw the batf abd fbi seem to want to bypass innoc until proven guilti not innoc until presum guilti where ar the video tape from the tank all of them don t tell me thei do not exist thei ar standard equip so you think koresh fire the place becaus of the explos a tear ga come with an aerosol to spread it thi aerosol is deliber made to be as non flammabl as possibl it is as non flammabl as possibl gotcha when in isol from other substanc why wa a pipe deliveryu system us rather than remot launcher why did the fbi not announc thi window blown in plu tear ga five minut then the wall come down and maintain a left to right sequenc b most aerosol also have a secondari compound that when mix in becom a veri flammabl and difficult to trace suspens with a veri special properti exposur to brief erupt of high heat muzzl blast or long exposur to low heat match a stove will not tend to ignit what other chemic come up in the forens who els will be allow to test the site c after a few minut to hour ifdesir the combnat rate can be control as desir the mixtur can be made to becom veryignit onb exposur to a temperatur abov a certain point a tracer round for a certain heat quantiti a small explos charg or for a length of time start a wall fire and wait check your militari record look at the tape why were tank larg capac delivei system tear ga why not somnorif and now why the hurri wa there still a comm channel open to the outsid do you see ani trace of fire come back to the compound in the video all the video which on ar miss do i sound paranoid mayb am i probabl not you trust the fbi and batf to render judgement in advanc of a court god help us for we ar sure not help ourselv you trut the feder gevern to give us a clean slate you ar trillion admit down and count look again did it happen that wai i do not know i wa not there and it should wait for a court to decid but will that happen peopl will not have the chanc to tell their side as the batf leader wa on camera no on win except more forc next time listen to your heart peopl thanx again stephen
