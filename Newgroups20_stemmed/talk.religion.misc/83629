first point is that ra thi equat lucif and jesu as be the same type of be ra howev lucif is a creat be thou wast perfect in thy ra wai from the dai that thou wast creat till iniqu wa found in ra thee ezekiel while jesu is uncreat and the creator of ra all thing in the begin wa the word and the word wa with ra god and the word wa god the same wa in the begin with god ra all thing were made by him and without him wa not ani thing made ra that wa made john and he is befor all thing and by ra him all thing consist colossian ra ra your infer from the ezekiel and john passag that lucif wa ra creat and that jesu wa not depend on a particular interpet of ra the word creat on with which mani christian mai not agre ra grant the mormon belief that all of god s children includ christ ra and lucif ar etern exist intellig which were organ ra into spirit children by god the term creation can appli equal well ra to both of those passag just briefli on someth that you mention in pass you refer to differ interpret of creat and sai that mani christian mai not agre so what that is realli irrelev we do not base our faith on how mani peopl think on wai or anoth do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popular of opinion also i find it rather strang that in try to persuad that creat and etern exist ar equival you sai grant the mormon belief you can t grant your conclus and then expect the point to have been address in order to repli to the issu you have to address and answer the point that wa rais and not just jump to the conclus that you grant the bibl state that lucif wa creat the bibl state that jesu is the creator of all the contradict that we have is that the ld belief is that jesu and lucif were the same ra your point that we all ar brother of jesu and lucif is also ra

the manifest of thi ra faith in receiv jesu that we ar becom the son of god but ra as mani as receiv him to them gave he power to becom the son of ra god even to them that believ on hi name which were born not ra of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but ra of god john ra ra ha it occur to you robert that be born of someon or be ra of that person or person s famili mai be a symbol term in the new ra testament mormon believ that we ar adopt into the hous of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have express ra belief that thi doe evinc a physic chang

righteous is not of god neither he that loveth not hi brother john on becom a child of god but as mani as receiv him to them gave he power to becom the son of god even to them that believ on hi name john behold what manner of love the father hath bestow upon us that we should be call the son of god therefor the world knoweth us not becaus it knew him not belov now ar we the son of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is john when he is born again through faith in jesu christ which were born not of

anoth for love is of god and everi on that loveth is born of god and knoweth god john whosoev believeth that jesu is the christ is born of god and everi on that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him john for ye ar all the children of god by faith in christ jesu galatian ra we ar told that and thi is life etern that thei might know ra thee the onli true god and jesu christ whom thou hast sent ra john life etern is to know the onli true god yet the ra doctrin of the ld that i have mention portrai a vastli ra differ jesu a jesu that cannot be reconcil with the jesu of ra the bibl thei ar so far remov from each other that to proclaim ra on as be true deni the other from be true accord to the ra bibl etern life is depend on know the onli true god and ra not the construct of imagin ra ra ra robert with all due respect who di and left you chief arbit of ra correct biblic interpret i don t mean to be snotti about thi ra but the fact is that the bibl is so differ interpret by differ ra group of biblic scholar what do you think of the jehovah s ra wit for exampl that to make refer to the jesu of the ra bibl is simpli ridicul whose jesu of the bibl do you mean thi is realli a red her it doesn t address ani issu rais but rather it seek to obfusc the fact that some group try to read someth into the bibl doesn t chang what the bibl teach for exampl the fact that the jehovah s wit deni the deiti of christ doe not alter what the bibl teach look for that bless hope and the gloriou appear of the great god and our saviour jesu christ titu simon peter a servant and an apostl of jesu christ to them that have obtain like preciou faith with us through the righteous of god and our saviour jesu christ peter on the deiti of christ we first look to the bibl to see what it teach to discount or not even address what the bibl teach becaus there ar some group that have differ view is self defeat to see what the bibl teach you have to look at the bibl ra our lord s mortal wa essenti to hi own salvat the ra promis messiah p he had to work out hi own salvat by ra do the will of the father in all thing ibid p he had ra to be baptiz to gain admiss to the celesti kingdom mormon ra doctrin p ra ra welcom to the wonder world of mormon paradoctrin robert the ra abov book ar by the late bruce r mcconki a former gener author ra of the ld church those book were not publish by the church nor do ra thei constitut offic doctrin thei consist of hi opinion now ra doe that mean that what he sai is not true not at all i ll have to ra think about the idea of christ s person salvat befor i come to ani ra conclus myself the conclus i come to mai seem heret to ra you but i m prepar to accept that i find thi rather curiou when i mention that the mormon belief is that jesu need to be save i put forward some quot from the late apostl bruce mcconki the curiou part is that no on address the issu of jesu need to be save rick come the closest with hi i have my own conclus to address the point most of the other repli have instead hop scotch to the issu of bruce mcconki and whether hi view were offici doctrin i don t think that it matter if mcconki s view were canon that is not the issu were mcconki s write indic of mormon belief on thi subject is the real issu the indic from rick is that thei mai certainli be robert weiss psyrobtw ubvm cc buffalo edu
