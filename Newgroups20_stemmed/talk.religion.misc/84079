subject re is it good that jesu di jason atlastel com jason smith write bskendig netcom com brian kendig write and i felt torn when i began to disagre with a lot of what the bibl and my priest told me did it start get a littl uncomfort did your style start feel a bit cramp ye that s exactli what i felt my heart just felt that what i wa be taught wa wrong a basic good messag but frame in error i could not with a clear conscienc accept that women were somehow not equal to men that homosexu ar guilti of their lifestyl that pride in on s work is a bad thing that jesu di for me i don t want anybodi to die for me especi as an imperson act where the person can t possibl even know me well enough to realli know if i m worth dy for or not i wa never abl to accept the bit about jesu s death be a good thing if that mean that i m just not comprehend a basic messag of christian then so be it mayb i m just not compat with christian i just refus to follow rule blindli and sinc i can t even convinc myself that your god even exist in the wai you describ it i ve got to just follow my own conscienc in these matter i know how that goe know i couldn t and didn t want to live up to those impossibleand rather incoveni rule ar what kept me outsid too don t think that my moral ar shoddi or nonexist just becaus i don t believ in your god i will not steal and i will not murder not becaus i fear divin repudi but becaus these just aren t in my charact you mai think there s noth keep me from just run around on a murder spree steal thing when i m abl insult peopl for the heck of it becaus i m not answer to anyon but you d be wrong i m answer to myself a life like that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself till i met the man that is my initi break with christian came after a lot of soul search and a lot of wonder why i could no longer feel the presenc of god with me i final decid that i had onc felt thi presenc just as i had felt my mighti teddi bear besid me when i wa a littl tyke protect me from the monster under the bed that i had believ in god just as i had believ in the teddi bear as someth of an emot crutch to protect me from perceiv danger sinc then i ve never abandon the possibl that mayb your supernatur triniti doe exist but there ar a few time when in my darken room by my bed i have set asid everyth i believ for a moment and call out to whatev s out there becaus i want to know the truth even if it mean abandon everyth i know and i have not yet receiv an answer onli when i truli listen to myself bodi and soul did i realiz that i could no longer honestli keep up the charad of be christian there is a higher truth in the univers and christian just ain t it ani suggest on what or who or where it might be and why nope it mai well be unknow scientist have suggest that the univers mai be finit and wrap around on itself the three dimension univers mai be map onto a four dimension superspher in the same wai you can map a two dimension plane onto a three dimension sphere see sphereland the sequel to flatland for more thought on thi our entir univers might just be an electron in a four dimension univers which in turn mai onli be an insignific speck in a univers abov that and so on and so forth until the variabl becom too much for us to even specul on that is there s no possibl wai for us to know exactli how we came to be so there s no reason at all to believ that your god exist nor had anyth to do with it ok you mai sai so now if i m just be good am i do good enough that s for you to answer if you feel you re do fine then go ahead and ignor us foolish littl christian we can present what we ve seen and experienc provid our wit but it isn t up to us to make that seed sprout christian have provid me with noth except quot from your holi book and all sort of tactic to try to get me to believ guilt trip insinu that i m without moral argument from disbelief how can you possibl believ that god doesn t exist and so forth all i m ask is for you to convinc me i want to be convinc but it s not go to be easi so much as you don t like what we re sell there just mai be someon out there that can identifi with it methink you could give us all a lesson in toler and back off have had year upon year of contact with your religion from both the insid and the outsid i view it as harm in mani wai it prei on peopl who want to find mean in their live and onc it s got these peopl it teach them to have piti and sometim starkli intoler of other who do not share these view mayb you ll sai that your religion doesn t teach that but i ve got to judg christian from the christian i know i feel that it is entir possibl and good to have faith in on s self and to be a posit influenc on societi for no better reason than that so i hope that my word in thi newsgroup will at least make some peopl think i want christian to realiz that there ar perfectli valid lifestyl and opinion that have noth to do with their deiti whatsoev and i want peopl who ar consid christian to realiz that christian doe not hold the sole kei to a happi fulfil life i have known some veri nice christian who have done some veri nice thing i think what set these peopl apart from the gener mass is that thei recogn that their religi belief mai be wrong and thei know the weak of their religion yet thei still decid to believ but thei keep their belief to themselv and do not think ani less of peopl who don t agre with them obvious the debat on the verac and reliabl of the sourc of the christian s faith is far from conclus notwithstand how vehement we propos otherwis precis my point you ve still not given me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem the nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deepli enough in it is that eventu you ll be abl to feel justifi in most anyth you want to do y know your right fortun for everyon around me i m not religi i m a christian just as the moslem aren t religi and the buddhist aren t religi who is religi then brian kendig je ne sui fait comm aucun bskendig netcom com de ceux que j ai vu j os croir n etr fait comm aucun de ceux qui exist the mean of life si je ne
