activ resist graviti at all time on land rather than suppli onli balanc forc that mean that much more energi would be requir for the creatur to function the bone also suppli leverag point for push and later movement that s why you don t find larg activ boneless creatur on land hydraul can make rigid tube no energi requir just for support hydraul also allow a creatur to produc larg forc with weak muscl us the principl of a hydraul jack rather than a lever thi is on of those ye but thing it s true that a hydraul pressur tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressur tube but even at psi level a hydraul hose will bend rather easili though it s straight on compress strength is high and it s torsion resist increas is practic nil on the other grasp member there s no doubt that hydraul leverag exist in natur tree root ar an exampl given time thei can shatter concret as osmot pressur increas it s interest to note that on land creatur ar either two leg or leg with tini insect have or leg but never leg though that would be a stabl configur it can be argu that leg creatur kangaroo ar leg the specif number of limb a creatur ha is an accid of evolut it is hard to make chang in some structur the panda ha a thumb plu as mani finger as it ancestor five on each hand but the thumb is a modifi wristbon rather than a modifi finger and extra finger ar much more common than extra limb especi fulli function on kangaroo limb i don t think so if you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkei and kangaroo ar limb i think the tail is a differ kind of structur grossli enlarg in the case of the kangaroo but primarili still an instrument of balanc rather than locomot i don t know much about panda thumb so i ll ask is it oppos thermodynam consider of surfac volum relationship would seem to dictat that activ complex creatur stai in a size rang similar to what we see about us inch tall intellig alien seem unlik as do those much larger than the eleph why can t a lemur or a brontosauru be intellig ye i know that the brontosauru is a mythic beast produc by put the head of anoth dinosaur on an apatosauru but so far space alien ar also mythic well i won t sai flat out that thei can t be intellig but i ll bring a coupl of line of argument to bear to try to show why i don t think it s like first let me sai that when i sai intellig i mean complex behavior in respons to novel situat on a level with or greater than human tool us and tool build ie assum suitabl manipul ar present on the creatur to allow it to alter it s enviro in a plan wai it will do so that s certainli not a univers or complet definit of intellig but it will suffic for a put technolog alien now no on know exactli what make a brain capabl of thought but it s gener accept that on of the criteria is a certain level of complex thi is gener determin by the number of neuron cell and their interconnect so a creatur the size of a lemur wouldn t have enough neuron to support complex thought thi argument is consider less clear in the case of the dinosaur there s room for a larg brain though no indic that on ever develop on reason thi mai be true is neuron speed the electrochem messag that trigger neuron requir time to propag thi make it difficult for a highli complex central brain to coordin the movement of veri larg creatur so there s littl select pressur for such brain instead a simpler distribut network evolv thi doesn t rule out intellig dinosaur but it point in that direct then there ar the thermodynam argument a tini creatur like the lemur need to eat frequent becaus it s intern heat is rapidli lost due to it s high surfac to volum ratio i contend that a creatur that must spend most of it s time and energi feed won t have the time to develop and exercis intellig that argument mai be somewhat weak the dinosaur s problem is the revers it must moder it s heat product becaus it s high volum to surfac ratio make it tend to retain wast heat i m assum that a certain temperatur rang is optim for chemic reactiv reason for product neuron function so creatur would tend to need to maintain a regul temperatur in a rang near that of human if thei ar carbon base that tend to rule out cold blood creatur as potenti home of intellig some peopl contend that some of the dinosaur mai have been warm blood but for a creatur the size of a brontosaur it s activ level would have to be restrain or it would be prone to gener an intern steam explos from the wast heat whale ar similar size but thei can reject heat to the ocean a much more effici sink than air i suspect that for intellig to manifest itself a certain degre of activ in interact with the environ is necessari ie monkei curious i doubt a larg dinosaur would be capabl of that much activ gari gari coffman ke zv
