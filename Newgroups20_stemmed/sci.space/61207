revenu from the us space busi ar current project to be about m in contrast to previou year when us commerci space sale had shown doubl digit growth rate thi year s project result ar driven by the us satellit manufactur industri where sale ar project to drop from satellit worth m in to satellit worth m in the us industri outlook also project u s commerci launcher face flat demand in come year and while predict that revenu will increas percent to m futur sale will be advers affect by the downward revis in depart of defens launch plan offset flat launch revenu and satellit deliveri revenu for

firm have been veri success in regain intern market share in the satellit busi furthermor sale of satellit ground equip should go up in the next revis of thi data expect to be releas about mid year data on mobil satellit ground equip sale includ such item as gp receiv and portabl satellit termin appear to be miss from the januari data set doc usual publish a list of space busi indic in mid year and the next revis of commerci space revenu should be releas then i expect the revis revenu should easili top m if the mobil satellit ground equip ar ad back into the number and the year should show about a overal market growth look beyond thi year s data futur market look quit promis the doc project satellit servic revenu could top m by if new mobil satellit servic and direct broadcast ar implement as plan and that mobil satellit station sale ar expect to continu to growth at per year through the mid s my number ar somewhat more pessimist for near term market growth but i agre the trend should be for substanti growth in us commerci space sale over at least the next year my pessim is due to more conserv assumpt on market captur and growth in leo commun and satellit direct broadcast servic i don t believ all of the current player in the yet to be born leo commun satellit market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcast market will be financi success nor that sale growth will be as explos as current project it should also be note thi year s doc data is the first releas to show revenu from privat fund micrograv research facil the m shown in the janurari data is

launch on demand servic from mdc for the time period with a launch to occur within dai of the request commentari if these two contract ar fulfil thei should provid an excel busi base for mdc s delta launch program through the turn of the centuri combin these two contract have a potenti for about launch worth about m to mdc and sustain a core busi base of m year other contract for intern and commerci payload as well as for nasa medium elv class payload will add to thi busi base keep mdc as a viabl commer launch compani howev it should be note there ar risk element in these contract motorola s iridium leo commun constel ha not yet receiv a us feder commun commiss licens for oper in the u s nor ha motorola line up all the financ and financi partner for the iridium ventur without

big chunk of chang for ani compani arian predict dip in launch demand arianespac the oper of the arian launch system is project a dip in launch demand in the late s in earli februari arianespac releas their annual market survei which detail their project of the space transport market for the next decad over short run arianespac expect to retain their domin posit and sustain a major share of the launch market of intern and commerci launch plan through arian hold contract for gener dynam atla vehicl hold contract mcdonnel dougla delta hold and great wall s long march vehicl hold launch contract three quarter of futur launch contract for which arian can compet ar project to come from commun satellit with the remain split between weather earth observ and scientif satellit most of the futur telecommun demand growth is predict to come from the asia pacif region arianespac expect the current market consolid of individu satellit oper into region or nation group will continu with these group invest in heavier satellit with larger commun payload carri more transpond arianespac predict the averag mass of telecommun satellit should increas by over todai s averag level to about kg in geo demand for commerci launch servic is expect to remain strong over the next three year but in the second half of the decad arianespac predict demand will decreas arianespac base thi predict upon a match of satellit transpond demand and suppli particularli as new data compress techniqu appear to could doubl or tripl transpond capac us exist or near term transpond on of the signific possibl chang in the market wa identifi as the arriv of new launch vehicl includ russian launch system but arianespac predict that in the long term investor purchas launch servic ar look for the best trade off between launch servic qualiti and price and that russian and other new launch servic will have to prove out their capabl and servic qualiti and their market penetr will be minim commentari arian releas their market survei annual and i report on their prior market survei in a past issu of csn sti compar the two survei there aren t outstand differ in the number the most notabl chang is the consider of new data compress techniqu reduc the demand for new physic transpond on orbit i note that in contrast to some predict demand for space base commun transpond appear to be remain strong while fiber optic line ar make substanti inroad into the establish point to point telecommun market grow demand for telecommun servic world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast servic have prevent a decreas in space transpond demand fiberopt cabl provid a higher capabl servic but onli from establish point a to establish point b to establish a fiberopt link it is necessari to instal cabl between the point and while there ar improv network solut instal a larg network of distribut fiberopt link can cost million or billion of dollar for broadcast servic where there is not an exist ground network structur satellit still offer the most cost effect solut and if new servic ar requir into a new region it is cheaper to instal a small satellit link cost onli a few ten of thousand of dollar and tie into the exist global satellit network thi allow rapid growth of new satellit servic and ha kept demand high the replac market for fiberopt is grow as well sinc as demand grow between the point servic it becom cost effect to later instal a fiberopt link to handl the increas in traffic sinc the telecommun and data transfer market ar still grow rapidli satellit market project remain rosi but satellit ar also get longer orbit lifetim current gener satellit ar now get guarante of at year of on orbit servic or more in contrast to year of servic from last gener s satellit thi ha cut back some of the launch demand as satellit owner ar reschedul replac satellit launch over longer interv and as last note arianespac didn t flag it thi year but it look like the space transport market will be rather over suppli by exist launch system in the near term the annual commerci launch demand is for about medium size satellit per year from the suppli side arian is capabl of launch up to about a dozen medium size satellit a year delta is capabl of about per year atla is capabl of long march japan s h vehicl russia s proton capabl of and other system such as zenit and soyuz anoth medium launch per year that s a lot of capabl for a small market we can onli expect the competit to intensifi for commerci launch ntsb investig pegasu launch over abort abort the feb pegasu launch by orbit scienc

abort destruct receiv stop respond the nasa test director and rang control in the mission control room at wallop island gave abort order about a minut befor the launch accord to the mission rule thi should have stop the launch somehow the osc test conductor order the abort revers and the nasa commun on the net relai that order to the b carri the pegasu at about second befor launch differ explain

befor the launch as we see more and more commerci launch more of these procedur issu ar go to crop up and will have to be resolv thi case is interest becaus it is the first time the ntsb ha been call in to investig a commerci launch problem as thei do with commerci aircraft problem i think thi problem will turn out to be primarili problem with procedur and commun and will be clear up with issuanc
