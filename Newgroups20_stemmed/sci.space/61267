subject re gamma rai burster how energet could thei be from belgarath vax mankato msu edu in articl rgvjsinnbhq senat bedfellow mit edu jfc athena mit edu john f carr write if gamma rai burster ar extragalact would absorpt from the galaxi be expect how transpar is the galact core to gamma rai how much energi doe a burster put out i know energi depend on distanc which is unknown an answer of the form x erg per megaparsec is ok john carr jfc athena mit edu i had to turn to on of my problem set that i did in class for thi littl problem i don t have a calcul but i do have the problem set that we did not too long ago so i ll us that and hope it s what you want thi is a highli simplifi problem with a veri simpl burst burst ar usual more complex than thi exampl i will us here our burst ha a peak flux of e erg cm sec and a durat of second dure the frst second of the burst and the last second it flux is half of the peak flux it s flux is the peak flux the rest of the time assum that the background flux is e erg cm sec then we had to find the integr luminos of the burst for sever differ sphere r pc oort cloud radiu r pc at the edg of the galaxi r pc or the edg of the galact corona and lastli at a r mpc we integr the flux over all time to find the fluenc then us the old standbi formula luminos pi r fpeak for a radiu of pc we found an l around erg sec pretti energet for close by for the coron model we found around erg sec and lastli for the cosmolog model an l that s what you d call moder energet i d sai ani suggest about what could put out that much energi in on second jeremi
