subject report on redesign team the follow is what thei feed to us most ha been post alreadi but there ar a number of item not seen here yet redesign activ updat follow is the weekli statu on redesign base on inform provid by nasa headquart the station redesign team srt provid a detail statu report to the advisori committe on the redesign of the space station on april the dai long meet wa held in anser facil in crystal citi va topic cover by the srt includ a preliminari mission and goal statement for the space station scienc technolog and engin research the assess process and the design approach discuss on manag option and oper concept also were held the design team then present the three option under studi option a modular buildup pete priest present the a option priest said the team is work to defin a station that meet cost goal and ha identifi three distinct phase of evolut power station human tend and perman presenc the team will defin the minimum capabl need to achiev each phase the total cost of each phase and the achiev capabl for budget level the a option us current or simplifi freedom hardwar where cost effect and is consid other exist system such as the so call bu spacecraft the orbit and spacelab the power station capabl could be achiev in flight with freedom photo voltaic modul provid kw of power dai shuttl spacelab mission dock to the power station ar assum for thi phase human tend capabl would be provid by the addit of the u s common modul modul which add subsystem and payload rack and dock port for esa and japanes laboratori dai mission with the orbit dock to the station ar assum for thi phase differ oper util mode ar be studi for thi phase option b freedom deriv mike griffin present the statu of option b activ griffin detail the evolut of the freedom deriv option from initi research capabl to human tend capabl to perman human presenc capabl to two fault toler and final perman human capabl griffin also outlin propos system chang to the baselin program with minor chang to the commun and track system crew health care system and eclss and a major chang to the data manag system initi research capabl would be achiev with flight to degre inclin flight to degre and consist of an extend durat orbit spacelab combin dock to a truss segment with photo voltaic arrai provid kw of power human tend capabl would be achiev in flight and add truss segment and the u s lab perman human presenc capabl would be achiev in flight with two orbit provid habit and assur crew return two fault toler achiev in flight would build out the other section of truss with anoth set of pv modul thermal control and propuls system the freedom deriv configur could achiev an intern complet state with flight three more flight to bring up the habitat modul a third pv arrai and two assur crew return vehicl acrv would complet the perman human capabl with intern stage griffin told the redesign advisori committe that elimin hardwar would not by itself meet budget guidelin for the freedom deriv option major reduct or deferr must occur in other area includ program manag contractor non hardwar earli util and oper cost he said option c sing launch core station chet vaughn present option c the singl launch core station concept a shuttl extern tank and solid rocket booster would be us to launch the station into orbit shuttl main engin would be mount to the tail of the station modul for launch and jettison after et separ the modul feet in diamet and feet long would provid cubic feet of pressur volum separ into deck connect by a central passagewai seven berth port would be locat at variou place on the circumfer of the modul to place the intern modul and other element thi can would have two fix photo voltaic arrai produc approxim kw of power fly in a solar interi attitud in hi close comment to the redesign advisori committe bryan o connor said a design freez would be establish for the option on april so that detail cost of the option can begin the next meet with the redesign advisori committe will be mai russian consult arriv in u s a deleg of russian space expert arriv in the u s on april and brief to the srt by member of the russian team began on the nd the group includ russian space agenc gener director y m koptev and v a yatsenko also of the rsa other on the team includ repres from the ministri of defens the design bureau salyut the institut of biomed problem the ministri of foreign affair npo energia and tsnijmash the russian team brief the srt on environment control and life support system dock system the proton launch vehicl mir oper and util and the soyuz tm spacecraft the russian consult ar avail to the srt to assess the capabl of the mir space station and the possibl us of mir and other russian capabl and system as part of the space station redesign thei will be avail to the srt through mai manag and oper review continu work continu in the srt subgroup the manag group under dr walt brook is work to develop a famili of option that solv the current problem and build a foundat for the transit to develop and oper variou manag option have been develop includ lead center with the center director in the programmat chain of command host center with the program manag report directli to an associ administr skunk work dedic program offic with a small dedic co locat hand pick program offic combin space station with shuttl with the space station becom an element of the current program major tune up to current organ with current contract and geograph distribut maintain but streamlin the oper group under dr john cox is build on the work of the oper phase assess team lead by gene kranz of nasa jsc which had alreadi begun a comprehens review of oper and had conclud in it preliminari result that signific cost reduct ar possibl as part of it work the oper group ha identifi team of agenc expert to develop detail evalu of each design in the area of assembl and oper util mainten and logist and test and ground oper what s in the week ahead the design support team will provid a comprehens statu of their option to the station redesign team on mondai and tuesdai at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detail cost assess also thi week the team will begin prepar for the next round of discuss with the redesign advisori committe to be held mai dr shea step down dr joe shea step down as director of the station redesign team on april and bryan o connor will take over the activ of the team dr shea submit hi resign as assist deputi administr for space station analysi but will continu to serv as a special advisori to nasa administr goldin and be avail to consult with the srt mr goldin accept the resign so that a request from dr shea to reduc hi workload could be accommod kei mileston the kei date for the srt as thei ar current be carri on the schedul ar april design freez on option for cost april design support team present select option to srt mai statu
