subject sirtf mission is still aliv from the jpl univers april sirtf is still veri much in busi by mark whalen in these time of extra tight nasa budget the veri surviv of a number of mission ha been uncertain but thank to major design refin implement in recent month jpl s space infrar telescop facil sirtf a major project consid to be in troubl a coupl of year ago is aliv and well accord to project scientist michael werner a lighter spacecraft revis orbit and shorter mission have ad up to a less expens project with tremend scientif power and a bright futur said werner design as a follow up to the highli success infrar astronom satellit ira and cosmic background explor cobe mission sirtf a cryogen cool observatori for infrar astronomi from space is schedul for launch in or if plan proce as schedul ira pioneer work in space base infrar astronomi year ago allow astronom to view the milki wai as never befor and reveal among other thing galaxi and comet it provid a sky survei time more sensit than ani previous avail from ground base observ cobe ha measur the infrar and microwav background radiat on larg angular scale and reveal new fact about the earli univers but to illumin sirtf s potenti jim evan jpl s manag of astrophys and fundament physic pre project recent said that the project is to million time more capabl than ira base on technolog advanc in infrar detector arrai howev despit the enorm stride in infrar explor sirtf promis and the fact that it wa cite as the highest prioriti new initi for all of astronomi in the s by the nation academi of scienc it took a diet or die direct from nasa headquart last year to keep the project go accord to werner the project is now known as atla sirtf base on the kei factor in it new design the satellit will orbit the sun instead of the earth permit the us of an atla rocket launch instead of the formerli propos and heavier titan the main advantag of the solar orbit is that you can us all of your launch capabl for boost the payload you don t have to carri up a second rocket to circular the orbit werner said the other advantag to a solar orbit he said is that it s in a better thermal environ awai from the heat of the earth addit major chang in sirtf s redesign includ shorten the mission from five to three year and build a spacecraft that is less than half as heavi as in the origin plan atla sirtf will weigh kilogram pound compar to titan sirtf s kilogram pound all of that add up to a less stress launch environ werner said and a cost save of more than million for the launch in addit to increas save in the design of the smaller less massiv spacecraft werner said sirtf s redesign came as a result of congress tell nasa you re try to do too mani thing if you want us to support sirtf which is a good project develop a plan to see how it fit into nasa s overal strategi shortli thereaft sirtf wa name as nasa s highest prioriti flagship scientif mission by the interdisciplinari space scienc advisori committe in addit to the bless from the nation academi of scienc while the spacecraft and it instrument requir descop to keep the project aliv sirtf s major scientif contribut alwai promis to come about from it advanc infrar detector arrai which will allow imag to be develop ten of thousand of time faster than befor accord to evan up until a coupl of year ago werner said all infrar astronomi wa done with singl detector or veri small arrai of individu assembl detector sinc then the depart of defens ha develop a program to produc arrai of ten or hundr of thousand of detector rather than just a few and those ar veri well suit for us on sirtf werner note that in addit to deal with budget pressur congress is current watch nasa project with an ey out for ani technolog spinoff on that question i think we have some thing to sai he said becaus the detector we re us ar straight off variou militari develop also sirtf will be built by the u s aerospac industri and it s a real technolog and engin challeng in addit to be a tremend scientif project sirtf will be us by the entir astronom commun werner ad but the revis three year mission put a premium on observ time we have to educ the user commun and develop a program that involv earli survei and quick turnaround of the data werner said the downsiz of the project requir a reduct in scope and complex of sirtf s three instrument the infrar spectrograph infrar arrai camera and multiband imag photomet howev these reduct will onli result in loss of effici rather than capabl he said the project hope to start a phase b activ in which will provid a detail concept for develop and design build the hardwar would begin about two year later project cost estim evan said ar million million i am veri optimist about sirtf he said it will provid a tremend return for the invest werner ad that an addit benefit from the project will be the enrich of our intellectu and cultur environ peopl on the street ar veri interest in astronomi black hole the possibl of life on other planet the origin of the univers and those ar the kind of question sirtf will help answer ron baalk baalk kelvin jpl nasa gov jet propuls lab m s telo the aweto from new
