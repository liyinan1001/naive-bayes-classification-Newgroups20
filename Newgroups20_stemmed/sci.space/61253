tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan republ aboard those booster were a new breed of venera probe for the planet venu design venera and the probe were meant not for land yet more spheric craft on the venerean surfac but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit to accomplish thi task the basic venera design wa modifi in numer area the central bu core wa made on meter inch longer to carri the two ton of propel requir for brake into orbit doubl the fuel carri by the venera and orbit eight year earlier extra solar panel were ad on to give the vehicl more power for handl the larg amount of data which would be creat by the radar imag the dish shape commun antenna were also made on meter larger to properli transmit thi inform to earth atop the buse where lander were usual place were instal the by meter by foot kilogram pound polyu v side look radar antenna the radar system possibl a terrain imag version of the nuclear power satellit us by the soviet for earth ocean surveil would be abl to map venu surfac at a resolut of on to two kilomet to mile the soviet probe imag paramet were a vast improv over the unit state pioneer venu orbit which could reveal object no smaller than kilomet mile in diamet and while the venera resolut wa compar to that of similar observ made by the meter foot arecibo radio telescop on the island of puerto rico the orbit would be examin the northern pole of venu thi region wa unobtain by either arecibo or pioneer venu and appear to contain a number of potenti interest geolog featur worthi of investig on octob after an interplanetari

twenti four hour venera follow suit four dai later the twin probe thu becam venu first polar circl spacecraft radar oper began on octob for venera and octob for venera for up to sixteen minut everi orbit over the north pole the probe would make a radar sweep of the surfac kilomet nineti mile wide and nine thousand kilomet mile long the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbit over the south pole to recharg their batteri and transmit the data back to two larg soviet antenna on earth each strip of inform took eight hour to process by comput by the end of their main mission in juli of the venera had map million squar kilomet million squar mile thirti percent of the entir planet venera and reveal that venu ha a surfac geologi more complex than shown by pioneer venu in the late s numer hill mountain ridg vallei and plain spread across the landscap mani of them appar form by lava from erupt volcano in the last on billion year in planetari term thi make the venerean surfac rather young hundr of crater were detect as well the largest of which had to have been creat by meteorit planetoid would be a better term here at least fourteen kilomet mile across due to venu veri dens atmospher there were some disagr between u s and soviet scientist on the origin of certain surfac featur for exampl the probe owner declar that the kilomet mile wide crater at the summit of meter foot high maxwel mont the tallest mountain on the planet wa the result of a meteorit impact american scientist on the other hand felt the crater wa proof that maxwel wa a huge volcano sit on the northern contin of ishtar terra in ani event the u s decid to wait on make verdict about venu until the arriv of their own radar probe schedul for later in the decad origin name the venu orbit imag radar voir it initi design wa scale back and the craft wa redesig nate the venu radar mapper vrm eventu the machin would be call magellan after the portugues navig ferdinand magellan circa thi vehicl would map the entir planet in even finer detail than the venera for the time howev the soviet probe maintain that distinct radar imag wa not the onli abil of the venera bolt next to the polyu v radar antenna were the omega altimet and the fourier infrar spectromet the latter for measur the world s temperatur the major of the area cover regist about five hundr degre celsiu degre fahrenheit but a few locat were two hundr degre hotter possibl indic current volcan activ the probe also found that the cloud over the pole were five to eight kilomet three to mile lower than at the equat in contrast the polar air abov sixti kilomet thirti six mile altitud wa five to twenti degre warmer than the equatori atmospher at similar height when the main map mission end in juli of there were plan for at least on of the venera to radar imag the surfac at more southernli latitud unfortun thi idea did not come to pass as the orbit mai not have possess enough attitud control ga to perform the oper venera and ceas transmiss in march of leav the soviet institut of radiotechnolog and electron with six hundr kilomet mile of radar data tape to sort into an atla of twenti seven map of the northern hemispher of venu venu by balloon for year the thick atmospher of venu had been a tempt target to scientist who wish to explor the planet s mantl of air with balloon born instrument professor jacqu blamont of the french space agenc centr nation d etud spatial cne had propos such an idea as far back as onli to have a joint french soviet balloon mission cancel in nevertheless late in the year such dream would eventu come true when two proton rocket were sent skyward on decemb and the soviet union provid western observ with the first clear full view of the booster which had been launch everi soviet venu probe sinc thi wa but on of mani first for the complex mission the unman probe launch into space that decemb were name vega and a contract of the word venera and gallei gallei be the russian word for hallei not onli did the spacecraft have more than on mission to perform thei also had more than on celesti object to explor name the comet hallei thi famou period travel wa make it latest return to the inner region of the solar system sinc it last visit in sinc it wa wide believ that comet ar the ici remain from the format of the solar system five billion year ago scientist around the world gave high prioriti to explor on of the few such bodi which actual come close to earth most comet linger in the cold and dark outer fring of the solar system some like hallei ar perturb by variou forc and fall in toward the sun where thei circl for millennia spew out ic and debri for million of kilomet from the warmth of each solar encount the soviet union along with the european space agenc esa and japan s institut of space and astronaut scienc isa did not wish to miss out on thi first opportun in human histori to make a close examin of hallei the esa would be us the cylindr giotto probe to make a danger close photograph flybi of the comet while japan s first deep space craft sakigak pioneer and suisei comet would view hallei from a much safer distanc scientist in the unit state also desir to studi the comet from the vantag of a space probe at on time envis a vessel power by solar sail or ion engin howev govern budget cut to nasa cancel the american effort the u s would have to make do primarili with earth base observ and the share of data from other nation though an instrument name the dust counter and mass analyz ducma design by chicago univers professor john simpson wa ad on the soviet mission in mai of the soviet answer to hallei were the vega instead of build an entir new craft for the mission the soviet decid to modifi their venera bu design to encount the comet while perform an advanc venu mission along the wai as vega and reach venu the buse would drop off on lander balloon each and us the mass of the shroud planet to swing them toward comet hallei much as the u s probe marin us venu to flybi mercuri eleven year earlier the soviet craft would then head on to hallei help to pinpoint the locat of the comet s erupt nucleu for the giotto probe to dive in onli kilomet mile awai in march of as plan the two vega arriv at venu in june of vega releas it payload first on the ninth dai of the month the lander make a two dai descent toward the planet the craft touch the upper atmospher on the morn of june sixti on kilomet mile abov the venerean surfac a small contain wa releas by the lander which produc a parachut at kilomet mile altitud thu the first balloon probe ever to explor venu had successfulli arriv on kilomet after the open of the parachut helium ga wa pump into the teflon coat plastic balloon inflat it to a diamet of meter feet dangl on a tether thirteen meter feet below wa the instrument packag properli known as an aerostat the top part of the kilogram pound aerostat consist of a cone which serv as an antenna and tether attach point to the balloon beneath it wa the transmitt electron and instrument connect at the bottom wa a nephelomet for measur cloud particl the aerostat wa paint with a special white finish to keep at bai the corrod mist of sulfur acid which permeat the planet s atmospher the vega balloon wa drop into the night side of venu just north of the equat scientist were concern that the ga bag would burst in the heat of daylight so thei place it in the darken hemispher to give the craft as much time as possibl to return data thi action necessit that the lander come down in the dark as well effect remov the camera system us on previou mission the author wonder though if thei could have us floodlight similar to the on attach to venera and in when soviet scientist had thought the planet s surfac wa enshroud in a perpetu twilight due to the perman thick cloud cover the first balloon transmit for hour right into the dai hemispher befor it lithium batteri fail cover kilomet mile the threat of burst in the dai heat did not materi the vega balloon wa station at a kilomet mile altitud after drop ballast at fifti kilomet thirti mile for thi wa consid the most activ of the three main cloud layer

the journei the layer s air temperatur averag forti degre celsiu degre fahrenheit and pressur wa a mere earth atmospher the nephelomet could find no clear region in the surround cloud earli in the first balloon s flight the vega lander wa alreadi head toward the venerean surfac both lander were equip with a soil drill and analyz similar to the on carri on venera and in howev vega would becom unabl to report the composit of the ground at it land site in rusalka planitia the mermaid plain north of aphrodit terra while still ten to fifteen minut awai from land a timer malfunct caus the drill to accident begin it program activ sixteen kilomet mile abov the surfac there wa neither ani wai to shut off the instrument befor touchdown nor reactiv it after land thi wa unfortun not onli for the gener loss of data but also for the fact that most of venu wa cover with such smooth low level lava plain and had never befor been directli examin nevertheless the surfac temperatur and pressur wa calcul at degre celsiu degre fahrenheit and earth atmospher respect dure the lander s minut of ground transmiss a larg amount of background infrar radiat wa also record at the site as had been done when the drill and camera on venera and had fail in decemb of the soviet focus on the data return dure the lander s plung through the atmospher the french soviet malachit mass spectromet detect sulfur chlorin and possibl phosphoru it is the sulfur possibl from activ volcano which give the venerean cloud their yellowish color the sigma ga chromatograph found that everi cubic meter of air between an altitud of and kilomet and mile contain on milligram grain of sulfur acid the vega data on the overal structur of the cloud deck appear to be at odd with the inform from pioneer venu the case wa made even stronger by the fact that vega s result nearli match it twin the vega found onli two main cloud layer instead of the three report by the u s probe the layer were three to five kilomet to mile thick at altitud of and kilomet and mile the cloud persist like a thin fog until clear at an altitud of kilomet mile much lower than the pv read on possibl for the discrepan ci mai have been radic structur chang in the venerean air over the last seven year when the lander and balloon final went silent the last function part of the vega mission the flybi bu sail on for a million kilomet million mile journei around the sun to becom the first probe to meet comet hallei on march the bu made a kilomet mile pass at the dark and ici visitor befor travel on in interplanetari space the soviet had accomplish their first mission to two celesti bodi with on space vessel on june vega releas it lander balloon payload for a two dai fall toward venu like it duplic the vega balloon radio inform back

aerostat s nephelomet fail to function the vega lander touch down on the northern edg of aphrodit terra s western arm on the fifteenth of june kilomet mile southeast of vega the lander s rest place wa smoother than thought indic either a veri ancient and worn surfac or a rel young on cover in fresh lava the soil drill wa in work order and report a rock type known as anorthosit troctolit rare on

hour sinc both vega craft were still function after their hallei encount soviet scientist consid an option to send the probe to other celesti object on prime target wa the near earth planetoid adoni which vega could pass at a distanc of six million kilomet million mile sadli the soviet had to back out on the opportun to becom the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it wa discov that there wa not enough maneuv fuel in the probe to reach adoni as plan vega and were quietli shut down in earli futur plan divert the impress vega mission had given some scientist numer idea and hope for even more ambiti expedit to the second world from the sun on exampl wa the vesta mission plan for the earli s thi soviet french collabor call for the launch of multipl probe on a singl proton
