vvejga trajectori the spacecraft will arriv at saturn in june of upon arriv the cassini spacecraft perform sever maneuv to achiev an orbit around saturn near the end of thi initi orbit the huygen probe separ from the orbit and descend through the atmospher of titan the orbit relai the probe data to earth for about hour while the probe enter and travers the cloudi atmospher to the surfac after the complet of the probe mission the orbit continu tour the saturnian system for three and a half year titan synchron orbit trajectori will allow about flybi of titan and target flybi of iapetu dion and enceladu the object of the mission ar threefold conduct detail studi of saturn s atmospher ring and magnetospher conduct close up studi of saturn s satellit and character titan s atmospher and surfac on of the most intrigu aspect of titan is the possibl that it surfac mai be cover in part with lake of liquid hydrocarbon that result from photochem process in it upper atmospher these hydrocarbon condens to form a global smog layer and eventu rain down onto the surfac the cassini orbit will us onboard radar to peer through titan s cloud and determin if there is liquid on the surfac
