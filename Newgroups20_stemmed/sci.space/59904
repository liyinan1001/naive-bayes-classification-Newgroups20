info at kennedi space center offici nasa shuttl statu report ar post to sci space new frequent why doe the shuttl roll just after liftoff the follow answer and translat ar provid by ken jenk kjenk gothamc jsc nasa gov the ascent guidanc and flight control train manual asc g c sai dure the vertic rise phase the launch pad attitud is command until an i load v rel suffici to assur launch tower clearanc is achiev then the tilt maneuv roll program orient the vehicl to a head down attitud requir to gener a neg q alpha which in turn allevi structur load other advantag with thi attitud ar perform gain decreas abort maneuv complex improv s band look angl and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuv is also requir to start gain downrang veloc to achiev the main engin cutoff meco target in second stage thi realli is a good answer but it s couch in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret we wait until the shuttl clear the tower befor roll then we roll the shuttl around so that the angl of attack between the wind caus by passag through the atmospher the rel wind and the chord of the wing the imaginari line between the lead edg and the trail edg is a slightli neg angl a neg q alpha thi caus a littl bit of downward forc toward the belli of the orbit or the z direct and thi forc allevi structur load we have to be care about those wing thei re about the most delic part of the vehicl the new attitud after the roll also allow us to carri more mass to orbit or to achiev a higher orbit with the same mass or to chang the orbit to a higher or lower inclin than would be the case if we didn t roll perform gain the new attitud allow the crew to fly a less complic flight path if thei had to execut on of the more danger abort maneuv the return to launch site decreas abort maneuv complex the new attitud improv the abil for ground base radio antenna to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antenna on the orbit improv s band look angl the new attitud allow the crew to see the horizon which is a help but not mandatori part of pilot ani fly machin the new attitud orient the shuttl so that the bodi is more nearli parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usual thi allow the thrust from the engin to add veloc in the correct direct to eventu achiev orbit rememb veloc is a vector quantiti made of both speed and direct the shuttl ha to have a larg horizont compon to it veloc and a veri small vertic compon to attain orbit thi all beg the question why isn t the launch pad orient to give thi nice attitud to begin with why doe the shuttl need to roll to achiev that attitud the answer is that the pad were leftov from the apollo dai the shuttl straddl two flame trench on for the solid rocket motor exhaust on for the space shuttl main engin exhaust you can see the effect of thi on ani daytim launch the srm exhaust is dirti grai garbag and the ssme exhaust is fluffi white steam watch for the differ between the top orbit side and the bottom extern tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and servic structur ar all orient basic the same wai thei were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttl gui i check with a buddi in ascent dynam he ad that the roll maneuv is realli a maneuv in all three ax roll pitch and yaw the roll compon of that maneuv is perform for the reason state the pitch compon control load on the wing by keep the angl of attack q alpha within a tight toler the yaw compon is us to determin the orbit inclin the total maneuv is realli express as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combin all three rotat matric in on four element arrai how to receiv the nasa tv channel nasa select nasa select is broadcast by satellit
