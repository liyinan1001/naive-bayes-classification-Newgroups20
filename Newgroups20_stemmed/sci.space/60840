subject re gun for space okai let get the record straight on the livermor ga gun the project manag is dr john hunter and he work for the laser group at livermor what you mai ask doe ga gun have to do with laser noth realli but the gun is physic locat across the road from the free electron laser build and the fel build ha a heavili shield control room thick wall from which the gun fire ar control so i suspect that the offic he work for is an administr conveni i visit hunter at the begin of feb and we tour the gun at the time i wa work on ga gun r d at boe where i work but i am now do other thing help to save the space station the gun us a methan air mixtur which is burn in a chamber about ft long by inch id i e it look like a pipe the chamber hold a ton piston which is propel at sever hundr m s down the chamber on the other side of the piston is hudrogen ga initi at room temperatur andsom ten of atmospher the piston compress and heat the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptur at around psi the barrel of the gun is about feet long and ha a inch bore it is mount at right angl to the chamber i e thei intersect thi wa done so that in the futur the barrel could be rais and the gun fire into the air without have to move the larger and heavier chamber the projectil be us in test is a kg cylind of lexan plastic in in diamet and about cm long all of the acceler come from the expans of the hydrogen ga from psi downward until the projectil leav the barrel the barrel is evacu and the end is seal with a sheet of plastic film a littl thicker than saran wrap the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residu air trap in the barrel ahead of the projectil the gun is fire into a bunker fill with sandbag and plastic water jug in the earli test fragment of the plastic projectil were found at the higher speed in later test the projectil vapor the test is into a bunker becaus the livermor test rang is about mile across and the projectil would go km if fire for maximum rang the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the test is complet where thei can fire into the pacif ocean and us the track radar at vafb to follow the projectil the design goal of the gun is to throw a kg projectil at km s half of orbit speed so far thei have reach km s and the gun is current down for repair as on the last test thei blew a seal and damag some of the hardwar i think it had to do with the methan air more deton than burn but i haven t had a chanc to talk to hunter directli on thi there ar peopl wait to test scramjet compon in thi gun by fire then out of the gun into the air at mach km s sinc the most you can get in wind tunnel is mach thi gun cost about million to develop and is basic a proof of concept for a bigger gun capabl of fire us size payload into space thi would requir on the order of kg projectil which deliv on the order of kg us payload to orbit dani eder dani eder meridian invest compani w h rt box athen al locat deg n deg w m alt
