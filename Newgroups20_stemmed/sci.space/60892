even some of the nasa center for the commerci of space all charg fee as part of the work down the street is on of the nasa commerci center thei charg a fee you total forgot the origin post that you post allen in that post you state that the wrap wa on top of and in addit to ani overhead geez in thi post you final admit that thi is not true now i m sure your a compet engin denni but you clearli lack experi in sever area your post show that you don t understand the import of integr in larg project you also show a lack of understand of cost effort as shown by your belief that it is reason to charg increment cost for everyth thi isn t a flame jsut a statement come your littl ol bun down here and you will find out who is do what and who is work on integr thi is simpli an ad hominum attack and you know it your employ doe charg a fee you mai not see it but you do of cours there is a fee it is for administr geez allen ani organ ha cost but there is a heck of a differ in legitim cost such as librari and other thing that must be there to support a program and wrap as you origin state it you state that wrap wa on top of all of the overhead which a coupl of sentenc down you sai is not true which is it allen sound like thei ar ad it to their overhead rate go ask your cost peopl how much fee thei add to a project i did thei never heard of it but suggest that like our presid did that ani percentag number like thi is includ in the overhead well there you ar denni as i said thei simpli includ the fee in their overhead mani seopar the fee sinc the fee structur can chang depend on the custom as you have post on thi subject allen you state that wrap is over and abov overhead and is a seper charg you admit here that thi is wrong nasa ha a line item budget everi year i have seen it allen get some number from that detail nasa budget and dig out the wrap number and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you ar bark in the wind no allen you did not you mere repeat alleg made by an employe of the overhead capit of nasa integr denni isn t overhead noth that reston doe could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa center where the work is go on integr could be done better at the center apollo integr wa done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophi of reston is total wrong allen there you have a bunch of peopl who ar complet remov from the work that thei ar try to overse there is no wai that will ever work it ha never work in ani larg scale project that it wa ever tri on could you imagin a reston like set up for apollo denni reston ha been the onli nasa agenc work to reduc cost when wp wa hemorag out a billion the center you love so much where do their best to cover it up and ignor the problem reston wa the onli place you would find peopl actual interest in solv the problem and build a station oh you ar full of it allen on thi on i agre that jsc screw up big thei should be respons for that screw up and the peopl that caus it replac to make a stupid statement like that just show how deep your bia goe come to msfc for a coupl of week and you will find out just how wrong you realli ar mayb not peopl like you believ exactli what thei want to believ no matter what the fact ar contrari to it kinda funni isn t it that someon who talk about a problem like thi is at a place where everyth is overhead when you have a bit more experi denni you will realiz that integr isn t overhead it is the singl most import part of a success larg scale effort i agre that integr is the singl most import part of a success larg scale effort what i completli disagre with is seper that integr function from the peopl that ar do the work it is call leadership allen that is what made apollo work final respons for the success of apollo wa held by less than peopl that is leadership and respons there is neither when you have ani organ set up as reston is you could take the same peopl and move them to jsc or msfc and thei could do a much better job why did it take a year for reston to final sai someth about the problem if thei were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is on heck of a lot i do not know allen but on thing i do know is that for a project to be success you must have leadership i rememb all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambl for year do you it is lack of respons and leadership that is the program problem lack of leadership from the white hous congress and at reston nasa is onli a symptom of a greater nation problem you ar so narrowli focus in your effort that you do not see thi why did the space new artic point out that it wa the congression demand chang that caus the problem methink that you ar be select with the fact again the stori you refer to said that some nasa peopl blame it on congress supris supris the fact remain that it is the center you support so much who cover up the overhead and wouldn t address the problem until the press publish the stori ar you sai the reston manag where wrong to get nasa to address the overrun you approv of what the center did to cover up the overrun no i am sai that if thei were locat at jsc it never would have happen in the first place if it take four flight a year to resuppli the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pai billion a year you state that your friend at reston said that with the current station thei could resuppli it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone thi mere point out a blatent contridict in your number that understand you fail to see you should know denni that nasa doesn t includ transport cost for resupli that come from the shuttl budget what thei where sai is that oper cost could be cut in half plu transport sorri gang but i have a deadlin for a satellit so someon els is go to have to do allen s math for him for a while i will have littl chanc to do so i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it wa wrong of reston to ask that the problem with wp be address i have the time to reiter on more timet that if the leadership that is at reston wa on site at jsc the problem never would have happen total ignor the lack of leadership of congress thi mani head hydra that ha grown up at nasa is the true problem of the agenc and to try to chang the question to suit you and your bia is onli indic of your posit denni univers of alabama in huntsvil
