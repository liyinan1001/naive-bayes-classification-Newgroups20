jp us planetari mission marin venu mar mercuri flybi and orbit marin the first u s attempt to send a spacecraft to venu fail minut after launch in the guidanc instruct from the ground stop reach the rocket due to a problem with it antenna so the onboard comput took control howev there turn out to be a bug in the guidanc softwar and the rocket promptli went off cours so the rang safeti offic destroi it although the bug is sometim claim to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it wa actual a transcript error in which the bar indic smooth wa omit from the express r dot bar sub n nth smooth valu of deriv of radiu thi error led the softwar to treat normal minor variat of veloc as if thei were seriou lead to incorrect compens marin becam the first success probe to flybi venu in decemb of and it return inform which confirm that venu is a veri hot degre fahrenheit now revis to degre f world with a cloud cover atmospher compos primarili of carbon dioxid sulfur acid wa later confirm in marin launch on novemb wa lost when it protect shroud fail to eject as the craft wa place into interplanetari space unabl to collect the sun s energi for power from it solar panel the probe soon di when it batteri ran out and is now in solar orbit it wa intend for a mar flybi with marin marin the sister probe to marin did reach mar in and took the first close up imag of the martian surfac in all as it flew by the planet the probe found a crater world with an atmospher much thinner than previous thought mani scientist conclud from thi preliminari scan that mar wa a dead world in both the geolog and biolog sens marin wa sent to venu in it reconfirm the data on that planet collect five year earlier by marin plu the inform that venu atmospher pressur at it surfac is at least time that of earth s or the equival of be feet under the surfac of an ocean marin and were sent to mar in and expand upon the work done by marin four year earlier howev thei fail to take awai the concept of mar as a dead planet first made from the basic measur of marin marin end up in the atlant ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot fail marin the sister probe to marin becam the first craft to orbit mar in it return inform on the red planet that no other probe had done befor reveal huge volcano on the martian surfac as well as giant canyon system and evid that water onc flow across the planet the probe also took the first detail closeup imag of mar two small moon phobo and deimo marin us venu as a graviti assist to mercuri in the probe did return the first close up imag of the venusian atmospher in ultraviolet reveal previous unseen detail in the cloud cover plu the fact that the entir cloud system circl the planet in four earth dai marin eventu made three flybi of mercuri from to befor run out of attitud control ga the probe reveal mercuri as a heavili crater world with a mass much greater than thought thi would seem to indic that mercuri ha an iron core which make up percent of the entir planet pioneer moon sun venu jupit and saturn flybi and orbit pioneer through fail to meet their main object to photograph the moon close up but thei did reach far enough into space to provid new inform on the area between earth and the moon includ new data on the van allen radiat belt circl earth all three craft had failur with their rocket launcher pioneer wa launch on octob pioneer on novemb and pioneer on decemb pioneer wa a moon probe which miss the moon and becam the first u s spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer wa origin design to flybi venu but the mission wa scale down and it instead studi the interplanetari environ between venu and earth out to million kilomet in a record until marin pioneer through were place into solar orbit from to pioneer and ar still transmit inform at thi time pioneer e would have been number suffer a launch failur in pioneer becam the first spacecraft to flybi jupit in pioneer follow it in and then went on to becom the first probe to studi saturn in both vehicl should continu to function through and ar head off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venu also known as pioneer venu orbit or pioneer burn up in the venusian atmospher on octob pvo made the first radar studi of the planet s surfac via probe pioneer venu also known as pioneer sent four small probe into the atmospher in decemb of the main spacecraft bu burn up high in the atmospher while the four probe descend by parachut toward the surfac though none were expect to surviv to the surfac the dai probe did make it and transmit for minut on the ground befor it batteri fail ranger lunar lander and impact mission ranger and were test probe for the ranger lunar impact seri thei were meant for high earth orbit test in but rocket problem left them in useless low orbit which quickli decai ranger launch on januari wa intend to land an instrument capsul on the surfac of the moon but problem dure the launch caus the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try to take some imag of the moon as it flew by but the camera wa unfortun aim at deep space dure the attempt ranger launch april had the same purpos as ranger but suffer technic problem enrout and crash on the lunar farsid the first u s probe to reach the moon albeit without return data ranger launch octob and similar to ranger and lost all solar panel and batteri power enrout and eventu miss the moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger through had more modifi lunar mission thei were to send back live imag of the lunar surfac as thei head toward an impact with the moon ranger fail thi object in when it camera did not oper ranger through perform well becom the first u s lunar probe to return thousand of lunar imag through lunar orbit lunar surfac photographi lunar orbit through were design to orbit the moon and imag variou site be studi as land area for the man apollo mission of the probe also contribut greatli to our understand of lunar surfac featur particularli the lunar farsid all five probe of the seri launch from to were essenti success in their mission thei were the first u s probe to orbit the moon all lo were eventu crash into the lunar surfac to avoid interfer with the man apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander the surveyor seri were design primarili to see if an apollo lunar modul could land on the surfac of the moon without sink into the soil befor thi time it wa fear by some that the moon wa cover in great layer of dust which would not support a heavi land vehicl surveyor wa success in prove that the lunar surfac wa strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from to onli surveyor and were unsuccess mission the rest becam the first u s probe to soft land on the moon take thousand of imag and scoop the soil for analysi apollo land feet from surveyor in and return part of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the seri wa a pure scientif mission which explor the tycho crater region in vike mar orbit and lander vike wa launch from cape canaver florida on august on a titan e centaur d rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slope of chryse planitia on juli it soon began it program search for martian micro organ there is still debat as to whether the probe found life there or not and sent back incred color panorama of it surround on thing scientist learn wa that mar sky wa pinkish in color not dark blue as thei origin thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particl in the thin atmospher the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulder stretch out as far as it camera could imag the vike orbit kept function until august when it ran out of attitud control propel the lander wa switch into a weather report mode where it had been hope it would keep function through but after novemb an errant command had been sent to the lander accident tell it to shut down until further order commun wa never regain again despit the engin effort through mai of an interest side note vike s lander ha been design the thoma a mutch memori station in honor of the late leader of the lander imag team the nation air and space museum in washington d c is entrust with the safekeep of the mutch station plaqu until it can be attach to the lander by a man expedit vike wa launch on septemb and arriv in martian orbit on august the lander touch down on septemb in utopia planitia it accomplish essenti the same task as it sister lander with the except that it seisomet work record on marsquak the orbit had a seri of attitud control ga leak in which prompt it be shut down that juli the lander wa shut down on april the orbit of both vike orbit should decai around voyag outer planet flybi voyag wa launch septemb and flew past jupit on march and by saturn on novemb voyag wa launch august befor voyag and flew by jupit on august by saturn on august by uranu on januari and by neptun on august voyag took advantag of a rare onc everi year align to slingshot it wai from outer planet to outer planet voyag could in principl have head toward pluto but jpl opt for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probe our knowledg of the giant planet their satellit and their ring ha becom immens voyag discov that jupit ha complic atmospher dynam lightn and aurora three new satellit were discov two of the major surpris were that jupit ha ring and that io ha activ sulfur volcano with major effect on the jovian magnetospher when the two probe reach saturn thei discov over ringlet and satellit includ the predict shepherd satellit that keep the ring stabl the weather wa tame compar with jupit massiv jet stream with minim varianc a year great white spot band cycl is known titan s atmospher wa smoggi mima appear wa startl on massiv impact crater gave it the death star appear the big surpris here wa the stranger aspect of the ring braid kink and spoke were both unexpect and difficult to explain voyag thank to heroic engin and program effort continu the mission to uranu and neptun uranu itself wa highli monochromat in appear on odditi wa that it magnet axi wa found to be highli skew from the alreadi complet skew rotat axi give uranu a peculiar magnetospher ici channel were found on ariel and miranda wa a bizarr patchwork of differ terrain satellit and on more ring were discov in contrast to uranu neptun wa found to have rather activ weather includ numer cloud featur the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on on ring two other ring and other satellit were discov neptun s magnet axi wa also skew triton had a canteloup appear and geyser what s liquid at k the two voyag ar expect to last for about two more decad their on target journei give neg evid about possibl planet beyond pluto their next major scientif discoveri should be the locat of the heliopaus soviet planetari mission sinc there have been so mani soviet probe to the moon venu and mar i will highlight onli the primari mission soviet lunar probe luna lunar impact attempt in miss moon and becam first craft in solar orbit luna first craft to impact on lunar surfac in luna took first imag of lunar farsid in zond took first imag of lunar farsid in sinc luna wa also a test for futur mar mission luna first probe to soft land on the moon in return imag from surfac luna first probe to orbit the moon in luna second success soviet lunar soft land mission in zond first success circumlunar craft zond through accomplish similar mission through the probe were unman test of a man orbit soyuz type lunar vehicl luna first probe to land on moon and return sampl of lunar soil to earth in luna accomplish similar mission in luna deliv the first unman lunar rover to the moon s surfac lunokhod in a similar feat wa accomplish with luna lunokhod in luna last soviet lunar mission to date return soil sampl in soviet venu probe venera first acknowledg attempt at venu mission transmiss lost enrout in venera attempt to imag venu dure flybi mission in tandem with venera probe ceas transmit just befor encount in februari of no imag were return venera attempt to place a lander capsul on venusian surfac transmiss ceas just befor encount and entir probe becam the first craft to impact on anoth planet in venera first probe to successfulli return data while descend through venusian atmospher crush by air pressur befor reach surfac in venera and mission profil similar in venera first probe to return data from the surfac of anoth planet in venera accomplish a more detail mission in venera sent first imag of venusian surfac in wa also the first probe to orbit venu venera accomplish similar mission venera return first color imag of venusian surfac in venera accomplish similar mission venera accomplish radar map with venera of section of planet s surfac in more detail than pvo vega accomplish with vega first balloon probe of venusian atmospher in includ two lander flybi buse went on to becom first spacecraft to studi comet hallei close up in march of soviet mar probe mar first acknowledg mar probe in transmiss ceas enrout the follow year zond first possibl attempt to place a lander capsul on martian surfac probe signal ceas enrout in mar first soviet mar probe to land albeit crash on martian surfac orbit section first soviet probe to circl the red planet in mar first success soft land on martian surfac but lander signal ceas after second in mar attempt at orbit mar in brake rocket fail to fire probe went on into solar orbit mar first fulli success soviet mar mission orbit mar in return imag of martian surfac compar to u s probe marin mar land attempt in lander crash into the surfac mar lander miss mar complet in went into a solar orbit with it flybi bu phobo first attempt to land probe on surfac of mar largest moon phobo probe fail enrout in due to human comput error phobo attempt to land probe on martian moon phobo the probe did enter mar orbit in earli but signal ceas on week befor schedul phobo land while there ha been talk of soviet jupit saturn and even interstellar probe within the next thirti year no major step have yet been taken with these project more intens studi of the moon mar venu and variou comet have been plan for the s and a mercuri mission to orbit and land probe on the tini world ha been plan for how the mani chang in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independ state will affect the futur of their space program remain to be seen japanes planetari mission sakigak ms t wa launch from the kagoshima space center by isa on januari and approach hallei s comet within about million km on march the spacecraft is carri three instru ment to measur interplanetari magnet field plasma wave solar wind all of which work normal now so isa made an earth swingbi by sakigak on januari into an orbit similar to the earth s the closest approach wa at h m s jst utc h on januari the geocentr distanc wa km thi is the first planet swingbi for a japanes spacecraft dure the approach sakigak observ the geotail some geotail passag will be schedul in some year henc the second earth swingbi will be on june at re earth s radiu and the third octob at re hiten a small lunar probe wa launch into earth orbit on januari the spacecraft wa then known as muse a but wa renam to hiten onc in orbit the lb probe loop out from earth and made it first lunari flybi on march where it drop off it lb midget satellit hagoromo japan at thi point becam the third nation to orbit a satellit around the moon join the unit state and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remain in orbit around the moon an appar broken transistor radio caus the japanes space scientist to lose track of it hagoromo s rocket motor fire on schedul on march but the spacecraft s track transmitt fail immedi the rocket fire of hagoromo wa optic confirm us the schmidt camera cm f at the kiso observatori in japan hiten made multipl lunar flybi at approxim monthli interv and perform aerobrak experi us the earth s atmospher hiten made a close approach to the moon at jst utc h on februari at the height of km from the moon s surfac n e and fire it propuls system for about
