subject galileo updat forward from neal ausman galileo mission director galileo mission director statu report post launch april spacecraft on april and delta differenc on wai rang dor pass were perform over dss goldston madrid meter antenna and dss goldston canberra meter antenna respect initi result indic the delta dor pass on april wa unsuccess due to ground station hardwar problem but the on on april wa successfulli perform on april a cruis scienc memori readout mro wa perform for the magnetomet mag instrument analysi indic the data wa receiv properli on april the spare power relai contact were command close via the spacecraft store sequenc these relai were command close by the cd command data subsystem prior to launch and were again command close to preclud the possibl at jupit of the pp relai wire be a sourc of intern electrostat charg iesd on april cruis scienc memori readout mro were perform for the extrem ultraviolet spectromet euv dust detector dd and magnetomet mag instrument preliminari analysi indic the data wa receiv properli dure the period from april to april a navig cycl wa perform thi navig cycl provid near continu acquisit of two wai doppler and rang data dure three consecut pass of the spacecraft over dss dss and dss on april real time command were sent to test slew the radio relai antenna rra in prepar for the mini sequenc slew test on april the rra wa slew from approxim degre from stow to approxim degre preliminari analysi indic the antenna slew to about degre which wa well within the predict rang the rra wa command back to approxim degre from stow preliminari analysi indic the antenna reach about degre also well within the predict rang the rra motor temperatur wa at degre c at the start of the activ and had increas to degre c at it complet after verifi proper rra slew the rra slew test mini sequenc wa uplink to the spacecraft for execut on april upon success uplink a delai action command dac wa sent which will reposit the stator on mai to it initi pre test posit also a dac wa sent to turn the two wai noncoher twnc on april prior to the start of the rra slew test mini sequenc on april a no op command wa sent to reset the command loss timer to hour it plan valu dure thi mission phase on april the rra slew test execut nomin the spacecraft under store sequenc control perform six rra slew start at about degre from stow and go to degre back to degre then to degre back to degre then to degre and then back to degre all of the slew were well within the predict rang the rra motor temperatur wa at degre c at the start of the activ and had increas to degre c at it complet after complet of the rra slew real time command were sent to reconfigur back to the pre test configur the ac dc bu imbal measur have not exhibit signific chang greater than dn throughout thi period the ac measur read dn volt the dc measur read dn volt these measur ar consist with the model develop by the ac dc special anomali team the spacecraft statu as of april is as follow a system power margin watt b spin configur dual spin c spin rate sensor rpm star scanner d spacecraft attitud is approxim degre off sun lag and degre off

the test wa success and the next test for v cmd is schedul for mai with dss goldston meter antenna the april system engin monthli report semr ground system develop offic gsdo mmr wa conduct thursdai april a review of current project and institut dsn and moso system statu wa conduct on go cruis develop plu the gsdo phase and deliveri schedul past month accomplish and potenti problem area were discuss no signific schedul chang or signific problem were report trajectori as of noon thursdai april the galileo spacecraft trajectori statu wa as follow distanc from earth km au distanc from sun km au heliocentr speed km per hour distanc from jupit km round trip light time minut second special topic as of april a total of real time command have been transmit to galileo sinc launch of these were initi in the sequenc design process and initi in the real time command process in the past week real time command were transmit were initi in the sequenc design process and on initi in the real time command process major command activ includ command to perform the initi rra slew test uplink the rra slew test mini sequenc dac to reposit the stator and turn the twnc on reset the command loss timer
