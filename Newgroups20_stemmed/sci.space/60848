subject re orbit repairst the difficulti of a high isp otv includ long transfer time radiat damag from vanallen belt for both the spacecraft and otv arcjet or xenon thruster requir huge amount of power so you have to have either nuclear power sourc messi danger and sourc of radiat damag or big solar arrai sensit to radiat or heavi that make attitud control and dock a big pain if you go solar you have to replac the arrai everi trip with current technolog nuclear power sourc ar strongli restrict by intern treati refuel even for veri high isp like xenon is still requir and turn out to be a pain you either have to develop autonom rendezv or long rang teleoper to do dock or and refuel you still can t do much plane chang becaus the deltav requir is so high the air forc continu to look at do thing thi wai though i suppos thei ar bide their time till the technolog becom avail and the problem get solv not imposs in principl but hard to do and margin cheaper than on shot rocket at least todai just a few random thought on high isp otv s i design on onc steve collin
