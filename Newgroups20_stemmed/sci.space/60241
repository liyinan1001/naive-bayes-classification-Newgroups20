subject nasa wrap in the april edit of on small step for a space activist allen sherzer tim kyger write anoth problem is what ar call wrap or sometim the center tax when work for a larg program like freedom or shuttl is perform at a nasa center the center skim off a portion which goe into what amount to a slush fund thi monei is us to fund work the center manag want to fund thi sum is estim to be over a third of the fund alloc think about that of the billion cost of freedom fulli billion won t be spent on anyth have anyth to do with space station now mayb that billion wa wise spent and mayb it wasn t but the work done with it should stand on it own merit not distort the cost of other project congress ha no idea of the existens of these wrap congress ha never heard the term center tax thei look at the station thei ar get and the price thei ar pai and note that it doesn t add up thei wonder thi blissfulli unawar that a third of the monei is go for someth els my dear friend your mix fact and fiction here a coupl of week ago when i first read thi in your post i talk with on of the cost expert here in space station at headquart if you wonder why i didn t post a respons immedi i do have a real job i m suppos to be do here at headquart dig up old khz data look into sherzer kyger claim rate pretti low on the totem pole of prioriti also i spent last weekend in kansa citi at the nation scienc teacher associ confer extol the virtu of ssf to scienc teacher first off ye the concept of center tax or wrap doe exist if i recal the number correctli the total tax for the ssf program for thi fiscal year is around million thi wa comput by ad up the wp wp and wp center tax with the ssf budget for thi fiscal year at billion my calculat sai the tax percentag is over the life of the ssf program us your figur of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a rate come to million thi is alot less than billion but i will conced it s still an appreci amount of pocket chang i should note that your estim of the tax rate at could be close to the actual rate the tax is onli charg on fund that ar spent at the center kind of like mcdonald at some state where you do have to pai sale tax if you eat the food at the restaur but you don t if you get it take out for exampl at wp the vast bulk of the fund we receiv go to the rocketdyn contract and ar not subject to the center tax i don t have the number in front of me but i d guess at least of the wp fund go to rocketdyn so you could be right about a tax rate of but it s onli appli to fund spent at the center and not to the prime contract thi lead to the obviou question what is the govern do with ssf fund that don t go to the prime contractor i e ok wp get a slice of the billion pie a big portion of thi slice goe to rocketdyn what happen to the balanc of the fund which aren t eaten up by the center tax at wp we call these fund we spend in hous support develop fund as thei ar support the develop work done by rocketdyn we have us these fund to setup our own testb to checkout the electr power system architectur our testb ha a real life solar arrai field left over from solar cell research research a few year back with lead acid car batteri to simul the nickel hydrogen batteri on ssf dc switchgear dc dc convert unit and simul load data from the testb wa us in a recent chang evalu involv concern about the stabil of the power system we have also us the support develop monei to purchas nickel hydrogen batteri which ar on life test at both lewi and the crane naval facil in indiana as a side point of the batteri cell on test recent hit the four year life test mileston cell have complet to cycl the on orbit batteri go through cycl per year as a final exampl my home divis at lewi us the support develop fund to purchas person comput and work station for perform system analys like model of the perform of the electr power system avail calcul us a mont carlo simul set up a databas with inform on weight of the power system element final the monei rais by the tax doe not all go into a slush fund at lewi the director doe control a small discretionari fund each year ani individu at lewi can submit a propos to the director to get monei from thi fund to look at pretti much anyth within the lewi charter most of the tax howev goe to fund the gener servic at the center like the librari the central comput servic divis the contractor who remov the snow etc thu it is rather difficult to determin what percentag of the ssf budget doesn t go for ssf activ to get an accur figur you would have to take the annual expenditur for the librari for exampl and then divid by the amount of the librari fund us to support ssf which would be hard to comput by itself how would you figur out what percentag of the bill for aviat week for year is billabl to ssf would you base it on the person hour ssf employe spend read av week versu the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compar thi estim of the ssf portion of the librari expens with the portion of the tax that goe to support the librari who know mayb ssf overpai on the tax to run the librari but we underpai for snow remov talk about a burecrat nightmar my last point is that i can t believ your claim that congress ha never heard of the term center tax unfortun all of the nasa testimoni befor congress isn t on a comput so i can t do a simpl word search someplac to prove you wrong but sure in some gao audit somewher these nasa cost method were document for congress
