subject re long term space voyang and effect newsgroup in articl rp ht g hsc usc edu khayash hsc usc edu ken hayashida write the first item of busi is to establish the import space life scienc in the whole of scheme of humankind i mean compar to footbal and basebal the averag joe schmoe doesn t seem interest or even curiou about spaceflight i disagre it think the averag joe is interest curiou about spaceflight but see it as an elitist activ not on which he is ever go to particip in all of us in our own wai can contribut to a comprehens document which can be releas to the gener public around the world the document would scientif analyz the technic aspect of long term human habit in space why is the gener public go to be interest in the technic detail of long term space habit i like the idea of the studi but it should be releas to other scientist and engin who will be abl to us it if you want a gener public document you ll need a more gener public i believ that if ani long term space explor program is to succe we need to basic learn how to engin our own microworld i e the spacecraft onli through the care analys of engin chemic biolog and medic factor will a good ecosystem be creat to facilit human life on a long durat flight as on work on control ecolog life support system engin the microworld isn t the problem the problem is understand the basic chemic biolog and medic factor to be abl to engin them effici for exampl the onli wai we know how to produc food is from plant and anim food synthesi is not veri far advanc so we have to orbit a farm well that s obvious not veri effici so we us technolog to reduc the mass and grow plant hydropon instead of us dirt thi is where the engin come in but new technolog bring new basic question that we don t have the answer to like in dirt we can grow tomato and lettuc right besid each other but in hydropon it turn out that you can t do that the lettuc growth is stunt when it s grown in the same hydropon solut as tomato so now you have to consid what other plant ar go to have similar interact thi mean some basic appli scientif research and that s what need to be done with all technolog that have been develop so far we also need to find out how thei interact togeth that s where we ar now so i would like to see post of opinion regard the most object method to analyz the accept scientif literatur for technolog which can be appli to long durat spaceflight first you need to do the literatur search there is a lot of inform out there mayb we should just pick a specif area of long term habit thi could be us especi if we make it avail on the net then we can look at method of analyz the technolog such a detail literatur search would be of interest to ourselv as space advoc and clearli import to exist space program in essenc we would be divid the space life scienc issu into variou technic problem which could be solv with variou technolog thi databas of accept solut to variou problem could form the basi of detail discuss involv peopl from the bionet isunet and ani other sourc unless there is an unbeliev outpour of interest on thi on the net i think we should develop a detail data base of the literatur search first then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysi the data base itself could be us for futur engin that s my respons ken what do you think tim
