subject re gamma rai burster where ar thei i feel compel to complain the statement that recent observ rule out merg neutron star as sourc of gamma rai burst is utterli fals even though it is popular enough to make it to bats press releas the idea behind the statement is as follow if you smack two neutron star togeth or have a neutron star be gobbl up by a black hole a lot of energi is releas enough for a gamma rai burst at a cosmolog distanc but so the reason continu thi energi is releas below a lot of matter so the radiat becom thermal and you expect to see roughli a blackbodi spectrum the observ spectra ar strongli non thermal so thi model must be wrong as so often the fault li with the imagin of the person who wa try to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it mai be that the initi energi releas is not seen as a gamma rai burst but the firebal of energi and matter that is creat mai spew out a relativist flow when thi slam into the surround medium a strong flux of non thermal gamma rai result which mai carri off a substanti fraction of the initi total energi all thi is not my idea it is in a seri of paper by martin ree peter meszaro sorri for the miss accent and co worker it is certainli not a complet model but it mai well be the best on around sum over all propos distanc scale an altern propos for what creat the initi firebal by the wai is the so call fail supernova scenario by stan wooslei in which a veri massiv star at the end of it life collaps to a black hole if the stellar core wa rotat part of the infal matter will be temporarili halt becaus it is support by centrifug forc and form a veri dens neutron toru that accret onto the black hole thi beast mai spew out a jet along the rotat axi which again constitut relativist flow the rate of such event mai be much higher than that of neutron star merger but the flux mai be more strongli beam so that the net rate of burst observ on earth stai the same between the two scenario but the energi releas per event can be a lot less in the fail supernova scenario on anoth note i do believ that the distanc scale must ultim be resolv via some classic astronom method such as find counterpart to the burst at other wavelength or find a definit signatur of some known class of object in the distribut of posit and flux theorist have histor not been too successful in find the distanc of ani object by prove that there is onli on possibl wai in which the object can work and therefor it must be so and so ralph wijer
