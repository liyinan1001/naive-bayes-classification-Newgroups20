subject dc y trajectori simul i ve been to three talk in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcrib some of my note below sinc my note take abil is by no mean infal pleas assum that all factual error ar mine permiss is grant to copi thi without restrict note for newbi the delta clipper project is gear toward produc a singl staget to orbit reusabl launch vehicl the dc x vehicl is a scale vehicl design to test some of the concept invovl in ssto it is current undergo test the dc y vehicl would be a full scale experiment vehicl capabl of reach orbit it ha not yet been fund on april th rocki nelson of macdonnel dougla gave a talk entitl optim techniqu for advanc space mission here at the univers of illinoi mr nelson s job involv us softwar to simul trajectori and determin the optim trajectori within given requir although he is not directli involv with the delta clipper project he ha spent time with them recent us hi softwar for their applic he thu us the dc y project for most of hi exampl while i don t think the detail of implicit trajectori simul ar of much interest to the reader i hope thei aren t i fell asleep dure that part i think that mani of you will be interest in some of the detail glean from the exampl the first exampl given wa the maxim of payload for a polar orbit the main restrict is that acceler must remain below gs i assum that thi is driven by passeng constraint rather than hardwar constraint but i did not verifi that the delta clipper y version ha engin booster and sustain the booster which have a lower isp ar shut down in mid flight thu on critic question is when to shut them down mr nelson show the follow plot of acceler vs time g as ascii graph go thi is actual fairli good the big differ is that the line g made by the should be curv which ar concav up the data is onli approxim as the graph wasn t up for veri long g g sec sec as mention befor a critic constraint is that g level must be kept below initi all eight engin ar start as the vehicl burn fuel the acceller increas as it get close to g the booster engin ar throtl back howev thei quickli becom ineffici at low power so it soon make more sens to cut them off altogeth thi caus the dip in acceller at about second eventu the remain sustain engin bring the g level back up to about and then hold it there until thei cut out entir the engin cutoff doe not acut occur in orbit the trajectori is aim for an altitud slightli higher than the nm desir and the last vestig of air drag slow the vehicl slightli thu lower the final altitud to that desir question from the audienc paraphras q would it make sens to shut down the booster engin in pair rather than all at onc a veri percept worth consid thei have not yet done the simul shut down all four wa part of the problem as given q so what wa the final payload for thi trajectori a can t tell us read aviat leak he also appar had a good propuls exampl but wa told not to us it my question doe anyon know if thi secur is due to sdio protect nation secur or md protect their own interest the second exampl wa reentri simul from orbit to just befor the pitch up maneuv the biggest constraint in thi on is aerodynam heat and the paramet thei were try to maxim wa crossrang he show graph of heat us two differ model to show that both were veri similar and i think we were suppos to assum that thi meant thei were veri accur the end result wa that for a polar orbit land at ksc the dc y would have about degre of crossrang and would start it s reentri profil about degre south latitud i would have ask about the land maneuv but he didn t know about that aspect of the flight profil josh hopkin jbh uxa cso uiuc edu find a wai or make on attribut to hannib
