write try come up with your own definit of ani or all self hate peopl to me ani who reject their cultur to the point where thei onli see the absolut neg of that cultur gener or regard a particular event and accept onli those view pure oppos aspect of that cultur thu select belief in us of histor fact and a complet ignor of context result hate their cultur i believ that thing ar get mix here critiz israel and or be anti zionist is not see the absolut neg of that cultur if that cultur refer to is isra be anti zionist can be seen as a complet denial of that entiti s right to exist and it legitimaci just as sai that islam ha no right to establish and implement a state that includ ani non muslim both ar absolut on dimension view of that cultur with regard to the issu of state mayb becaus a person can see the posit of that cultur is that that person oppos zionism and the action of the state of israel if that were the case on would expect a few of that cultur s posit to be discuss with regard to the issu at hand sinc the issu center on isra cultur i have yet to hear of ani posit of that cultur in thi discuss i for on consid the action of the state of israel with respect to the human right of the palestinian peopl as an exampl of an action thati oppos what jewish cultur wa suppos to uphold as an exampl of respect and what the jewish peopl learn about oppres segreg and year in the diaspora i agre with you but i also feel that when a cultur feel it is confront by anoth group that wish to see that cultur disassembl the first cultur ha littl choic but to try to secur it surviv as well as maintain it moral center sinc the cultur is not about to turn awai from either the matter of it surviv or the valu of it moral principl it ha the virtual imposs job of balanc to discuss israel s fault and crime without ani recognit of thi circumst and realiti it face is a consciou decis base on the discuss s polit bias not on an honest and empathet open understand of the situat the same appli to those who attempt to paint the palestinian movement as all bad and dispens with consider of the realiti face them that certainli describ elia sinc he ha no intent of recogn that alongsid the palestinian experi and perspect there exist also that of isra he might not want to recogn that it doe not make him a self hate jew as far as i see it at most he is a person who is not tell the truth you beg the question by center on the symptom while the issu of self hate address the motiv i certainli feel that anyon who expend so much effort inflat distort and rob human context from aspect of hi her own cultur is reflect a degre of dislik for it sinc bit of that cultur ar bound due to hi her upbring to be a part of him her a bit of self dislik seem like to be mix in somewher who is a jew a person whose integr decai when unmov by the knowledg of wrong done to other peopl a j heschel that is why i get move when i see the isra armi kill peopl in the occupi territori as much as i get move when i see a plestinian stabe peopl in israel and thi is precis why isra societi ha been tremend harm by the action it it govern ha felt it had to take in respons to an other perceiv as a threat just as with you there ha long been a strident and emot debat about the pain isra feel when forc to balanc desir for surviv and moral belief the trauma of have to make that choic is made wors by the fact that neither can be conveni brush asid as a result of a reason polit debat for the sake of the other onli reshap but so far it seem that the blame is alwai put on the other if you read thi newsgroup for exampl israel is never guilti by herself she is alwai respond to the action of the other and it goe as if the action of isreal do not also affect the respons of the other in a cycl that never end also there is blind to try to understand what the other feel and why as you well know thi process of blame the other for the moral question action on side is forc by the other of cours to take is thoroughli practic by both side if you ar onli hear the pro isra crowd s self support argument that mai be due to the fact that you ar not listen for anyth els i certainli hear the similarli distort pro palestinian pro arab element in thi newsgroup as well as in soc cultur arab there is alwai and excus there is alwai a rational to explain why thing happen as thei do and what is the worst part for me there seem to be all the time an intent to try to de human the other as if the other did not care about their futur children peac etc etc aap i agre agre agre agre howev in my respons to the initi discuss abov between davidsson and those oppos hi present i saw davidsson carefulli put academ frill around a blatantli on side seri of i hate dislik them yesido yesido yesido i did not find the approach of those oppos davidsson to be center at all on a denigr and denial of the other side i certainli do wonder if the degre to which davidsson s view on the middl east have distort is connect to hi dislik and reject of hi jewish lineag have said thi howev i agre with you that thi constant accus other of be self hate jew seem pointless it is not wors a label than is why you re on their side except to perhap impli a certain degre of overli enthusiast biased tim tim clock ph d graduat student uci tel depart of polit and societi fax univers of california irvin home tel
