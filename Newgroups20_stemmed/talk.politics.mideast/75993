differ vision of the interim stage is wrong for two reason the present palestinian and isra leadership ar as moder as is like to exist for mani year so the present opportun mai be the last for a signific period sinc these negoti ar not design to or even attempt to resolv the conflict attent to issu deal with a desir final statu ar mi place and potenti destruct given thi how should propos from either side be alter to temper their maximalist approach as state abov how can isra worri and desir for some interim control be address while provid for a veri real interim palestinian self govern entiti tim april respons by al moor l lmsc is lmsc lockhe com basic the problem is that israel mai remain or leav the occupi territori it cannot do both it cannot do neither so far isra continu to propos that thei remain the palestinian propos that thei leav why should either chang their view it is worth point out that the onli area of compromis accomod both view seem to requir a reduct in the isra presenc israel propos no such reduct and in fact mai be said to not be negoti tim there seem to be two percept that have to be address the first is that of israel where there is littl trust for arab group so there is littl support for israel give up tangibl asset in exchang for piec of paper expect hope etc the second is that of the arab world palestinian where there is the demand that these tangibl concess be made by israel without it receiv anyth tangibl back given thi the gap between the two stanc seem to be the need by israel of receiv some tangibl return for it expect concess by tangibl is meant someth that provid israel with compar protect from the land it is to give up in some wai ensur that the arab state and palestin will be account and held activ not just diplomat respons for the uphold of all action on it territori by citizen or visitor in essenc i do not believ that israel object to palestinian statehood would be anywher near as strong as thei ar now if israel wa assur that ani new palestinian state would be commit to co exist with israel and held respons for all attack on israel from it territori asid from some of the rather slant propos abov how could such guarante be instil for exampl how could such guarante control be ad to the palestinian pisga propos israel is hang on larg becaus it is scare stiff that the minut it let go give land back to arab state no more buffer zone give full autonomi to palestinian ani and or all of the arab parti could and would if not control somehow easili return to the tradit anti israel posit the question then is how to realli ensur that that will not happen tim
