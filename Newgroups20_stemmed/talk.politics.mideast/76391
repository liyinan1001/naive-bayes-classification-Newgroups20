did in kafan thei kill our women our girl our mother thei cut their breast off and burn our hous and so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you thi whole time some of them ar destroi the hous and the other ar shout at us thei were mostli young peopl under at first there weren t ani older peopl among them and all of their face were unfamiliar sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of peopl by their face especi me i m a teacher so thei drag my father into the other room thei twist hi arm and took him in there no thei didn t take him in there thei drag him in there becaus he wa alreadi unabl to walk thei close the door to that room all but a crack we couldn t see what wa happen to father what thei were do to him then a young man about year old start to tear off mamma s sarafan and mamma shout at him in azerbaijani i m old enough to be your mother what ar you do he struck her now he s be held mamma identifi him i hope he s convict then thei went

she fell down thei beat her but she didn t cry out even when thei tore her cloth off she kept repeat what did we do to you what did we do to you and even later when she came to she said mamma what did we do to them why did thei do that to us that group wa prepar i know thi becaus i notic that some of them onli broke up furnitur and other onli dealt with us i rememb that when thei were beat me when thei were tear my cloth off i felt neither pain nor shame becaus my entir attent wa rivet to karina all i could do wa watch how much thei beat her and how pain it wa for her and what thei did to her that s why i felt no pain later when thei carri karina off thei beat her savag it s realli amaz that she not onli live but didn t lose her mind she is veri beauti and thei did everyth thei could to destroi her beauti mostli thei beat her face with their fist kick her us anyth thei could find mamma karina and i were all in on room and again i didn t feel ani pain just didn t feel ani no matter

be more room then someon suggest let s take her outsid those beast were in heaven thei did what thei would do everi dai if thei weren t afraid of the author those were their true color at the time i thought that in fact thei would alwai behav that wai if thei weren t afraid of what would happen to them when thei carri karina out and beat mamma her face wa complet cover with blood that s when i start to feel the pain i black out sever time from the pain but each moment that i had my ey open it wa as though i were record it all on film i think i m a kind person by natur but i m veng especi if someon is mean to me and i don t deserv it i hold a grudg a long time if someon intention caus me pain and everi time i would come to and see on of those anim on top of me i d rememb them and i ll rememb them for the rest of my life even though peopl tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on live at some point i rememb that thei stood me up and told me someth and despit the fact that i hurt all over i had been beaten terribl i found the strength in myself to interfer with their tortur i realiz that i had to do someth resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffer to an end i push on of them awai he wa a real hors i rememb now that he s be held too as though thei were all wait for it thei seiz me and took me out onto the balconi i had long hair and it wa stuck all over me on of the veranda shutter to the balconi wa open and i realiz that thei plan to throw me out the window becaus thei had alreadi pick me up with their hand i wa up in the air as though for the last time i took a realli deep breath and close my ey and somehow brace myself insid i suddenli becam cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet and suddenli i felt myself fly i couldn t figur out if i wa realli fly or if i just imagin it when i came to i thought now i m go to smash on the ground and when it didn t happen i open my ey and realiz that i wa still ly on the floor and sinc i didn t scream didn t beg them at all thei becam all the more wild like wolv thei start to trampl me with their feet shoe with heel on them and iron horsesho like thei had spe cialli put them on then i lost conscious i came to a coupl of time and wait for death summon it beseech it some peopl ask for good health life happi but at that moment i didn t need ani of those thing i wa sure that none of us would surviv and i had even forgotten about marina and if none of us wa aliv it wasn t worth live there wa a moment when the pain wa especi great i withstood inhuman pain and realiz that thei were go to torment me for a long time to come becaus i had show myself to be so tenaci i start to strangl myself and when i start to wheez thei realiz that with my death i wa go to put an end to their pleasur and thei pull my hand from my throat the person who injur and insult me most painfulli i rememb him veri well becaus he wa the oldest in the group he look around i know that he ha four children and that he consid himself an ideal father and person on who would never do such a thing someth came over him then you see even dure the investig he almost call me daughter he apolog although of cours he knew that i d never forgiv him someth like that i can never forgiv i have never injur anyon with my behavior with my word or with my deed i have alwai put myself in the other person s shoe but then in a matter of hour thei trampl me entir i shall never forget it i want to do myself in then becaus i had noth to lose becaus no on could protect me my father who tri to do someth against that hoard of beast by himself could do noth and wouldn t be abl to do anyth i knew that i wa even sure that he wa no longer aliv and ira melkumian my acquaint i knew her and had been to see her famili a coupl of time her brother tri to save her and couldn t so he tri to kill her hi veri own sister he threw an ax at her to kill her and put an end to her suffer when thei strip her cloth off and carri her into the other room her brother knew what await her i don t know which on it wa edik or igor both of them were in the room from which the ax wa thrown but the ax hit on of the peopl carri her and so thei kill her and made her death even more excruci mayb the most excruci of all the death of those dai in sumgait i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumian land hi name is makhaddin he know my famili a littl he came to see how we had gotten settl in the new apart in baku how we were feel and if we need anyth he s a good person he said you should prais god that you all surviv but what i saw with my own ey i a man who ha seen so mani peopl die who ha live a whole life i he sai nearli lost my mind that dai i had never seen the like of it and think i never shall again the door to hi apart wa open and he saw everyth on of the brother threw the ax becaus thei had alreadi taken the father and mother out of the apart igor edik and ira remain he saw ira nake be carri into the other room in the hand of six or seven peopl he told us about it and said he would never forget it he heard the brother shout someth inarticul from pain rage and the fact that thei were powerless to do anyth but all the same thei tri to do someth the gui who got hit with the ax live i i after i had been unsuccess at kill myself i saw them take marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i wa in such a state that i couldn t even rememb my sister s name i want to cry marina out to her but could not i look at her and knew that it wa a familiar dear face but couldn t for the life of me rememb what her name wa and who she wa and thu i save her becaus when thei were take her out she as it turn out had told them that she had just been visit and that she and lyuda were both there by chanc that thei weren t armenian lyuda s a russian you can tell right awai and marina speak azerbaijani wonderfulli and she told them that she wa an azerbaijani and i almost gave her awai and doom her i m glad that at least marina came out of thi all in good physic health although her spirit wa murder at some point i came to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaint in that mob he live in the neighbor build for some reason i rememb hi name mayb i sens my defens in him i call out to him in russian igor help but he turn awai and went into the bedroom just then thei were take marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor said he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact wa azerbaijani and he took both of them to the neighbor and the idea stole through me that mayb igor had led them to our apart someth like that but if he wa my friend he wa suppos to save me then thei were strike me veri hard we have an indian vase a metal on thei were hit me on the back with it and i black out thei took me out onto the balconi a second time to throw me out the window thei were alreadi sure that i wa dead becaus i didn t react at all to the new blow someon said she s alreadi dead let s throw her out when thei carri me out onto the balconi for the second time when i wa about to die the second time i heard someon sai in azerbaijani don t kill her i know her she s a teacher i can still hear that voic ring in my ear but i can t rememb whose voic it wa it wasn t igor becaus he speak azerbaijani with an accent hi mother is russian and thei speak russian at home he speak azerbaijani wors than our marina doe i rememb when thei carri me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and i have open my ey saw and recogn that person but immedi pass out cold i had been beaten so much that i didn t have the strength to rememb him i onli rememb that thi person wa older and he had a high posit unfortun i can t rememb anyth more what should i sai about igor he didn t treat me badli i had heard a lot about him that he wasn t that good a person that he sometim drank too much onc he boast to me that he had serv in afghanistan he knew that women usual like braveri in a man especi if a man wa in afghanistan if he wa wound then it s about eighti percent sure that he will be treat veri sympathet with respect later i found out that he had serv in ufa and wa injur but that s not in afghanistan of cours i found that all out later among the peopl who were in our apart my karina also saw the secretari of the parti organ i don t know hi last name hi first name is najaf he is an armenian born azerbaijani but later karina wasn t so sure she wa no longer a hundr percent sure that it wa he she saw and she didn t want to endang him she said he wa there and a littl while later mayb thei beat me so much that i am confus him with someon els no it seem like it wa he i am sure it wa he becaus when he came to see us the first time he said on thing and the next time he said someth entir differ the investig haven t summon him yet he came to see us in the khimik board hous where we were live at the time he brought groceri and flower thi wa right befor march th he almost start cry he wa so upset to see our condit i don t know if he wa put us on or not but later after we had told the investig and thei summon him to the procuraci he said that he had been in baku he wasn t in sumgait the fact that he chang hi testimoni lead me to believ that karina is right that in fact it wa he who wa in our apart i don t know how the investig ar now treat him at on point i wonder and ask and wa told that he had an alibi and wa not in our apart couldn t he have gone to baku and arrang an alibi i m not rule out that possibl ill now return to our apart mamma had come to you could sai that she bought them off with the
