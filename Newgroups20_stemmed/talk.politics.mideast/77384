destruct of mosqu includ priceless histor monument complet the erad of the muslim presenc from territori claim by serb i strongli disput your notion that croat had a similar older agenda in fact for

bosnia into pure cathol state croatia never had mani muslim citizen for histor reason becaus it wa not a part of the ottoman empir the last major battl between austro hungarian monarchi and the ottoman empir in croatia were at the end of the th centuri need i remind you that modern croatian nation came into be with dr ant starcev who saw bosnian muslim as the best croat so much so that in he

of croatia in intern relat you ll learn that unless weak unit to counterbal the strong player soon thei ar taken over and that s the end of them balanc of power think ha brought togeth croat and bosnian muslim thi is onli natur all other align ar unstabl i m work on point out thi basic fact croat and muslim have been awar of it for as long as serbia ha exist you ar wrong if you think onli imag is at stake here croatia ha a deep interest in her allianc with bosnian muslim and vice versa i think tudjman understand thi although he doe not have much choic at thi point tension should have been defus better earlier befor ani open confront develop although i still think croatia will surviv it will lose a lot but bosnian muslim mai end up even wors off howev their posit now is so horribl that perhap thei do not see it get ani wors the kei point is do thei still have ani hope left if not then all bet ar off mr stojanov is clearli veri veri happi about thi i m deepli hurt thi is not about some imag but about surviv of a concept of a partnership which i believ is natur and essenti for both croat and muslim sigh josip
