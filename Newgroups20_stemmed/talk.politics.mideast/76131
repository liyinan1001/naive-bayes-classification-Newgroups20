europ s worker the zionist were propos a new programm aim at rid europ of it jew by set up some form of a jewish state histor noth is inevit all depend on the balanc of forc involv in the struggl histori can be seen as an option tree everi time a certain option is chosen other rout becom bar becaus of that choic movement backward to the point befor that choic wa made is imposs while zionism as an option wa taken by mani young jew it remain a minor posit until the first dai of the rd reich the zionist feder of germani zvfd an organis repres a tini minor of german jew wa select by the nazi as the bodi to repres the jew of the reich it wa the onli flag of an interant organis allow to fly in berlin and thi wa the onli intern organis allow to oper dure thi period from a margin posit the leader of the zionist feder were propel to a promin and central that surpris even them all of a sudden thei attain polit power power base not on represent but from be select as the choic of the nazi regim for deal with the the jewish problem their posit in negoti with the nazi agreement that affect the live of mani ten of thousand of the jew in germani transform them from a utopian margin organis in germani and some other countri in europ into a real option to be consid by german jew the best exampl of thi wa the transfer agreement of immedi after the nazi takeov in jew all over the world support or were organis a world wide boycott of german good thi campaign hurt the nazi regim and the german author search frantic for a wai disabl the boycott it wa clear that if jew and jewish organis were to pull out the campaign would collaps thi problem wa solv by the zvfd a letter sent to the nazi parti as earli as june outlin the degre of agreement that exist between the two organis on the question of race nation and the natur of the jewish problem and it offer to collabor with the new regim the realis of zionism could onli be hurt by resent of jew abroad against the german develop boycott propaganda such as is current be carri out against germani in mani wai is in essenc unzionist becaus zionism want not to do battl but to convinc and build in their eager to gain credenc and the back of the new regim the zionist organis manag to undermin the boycott the main public act wa the signatur of the transfer agreement with the nazi author dure the zionist congress of in essenc the agreement wa design to get germani s jew out of the countri and into mandat palestin it provid a possibl for jew to take a sizeabl part of their properti out of the countri through a transfer of german good to palestin thi right wa deni to jew leav to ani other destin the zionist organis wa the act agent through it financi organis thi agreement oper on a number of front help jew to leav the countri break the ring of the boycott export german good in larg quantiti to palestin and last but not least enabl the regim to be seen as human and reason even toward it avow enemi the jew after all thei argu the jew do not belong in europ and now the jew come and agre with them after new of the agreement broke the boycott wa doom if the zionist organ found it possibl and necessari to deal with the nazi and import their good who could argu for a boycott thi wa not the first time that the interest of both movement were present to the german public as complementari baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish depart of the ss later follow by eichmann wa invit to travel to palestin thi he did in earli in the compani of a zionist leader kurt tuchler have spent six month in palestin he wrote a seri of favour articl in der sturmer describ the new jew of zionism a jew nazi could accept and understand thi littl known episod establish quit clearli the relationship dure the earli dai of nazism between the new regim and the zvfd a relationship that wa echo later in a number of kei instanc even after the natur of the final solut becam clear in mani case thi meant a silenc of report about the horror of the extermin a book concentr on thi aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is post ugandan zionism in the crucibl of the holocaust by s b beth zvi in the case of the kastner episod around which jim allen s plai perdit is base even the normal excus of lack of knowledg of the real natur of event doe not exist it occur near the end of the war the ussr had advanc almost up to germani itali and the african base had been lost the nazi were on the run with a number of kei countri such as rumania leav the axi a second front wa a matter of month awai as the western alli prepar their forc in the midst of all thi we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industri murder set up hi hz in occupi budapest after the german takeov of the countri in april hi first act wa to have a confer with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist feder member head by kastner as the agent and clear hous for all jew and their relationship with the ss and the nazr author why thei did thi is not difficult to see as oppos to poland where it three and a half million jew live in ghetto and were visibl differ from the rest of the polish popul the hungarian jew were an integr part of the commun the middl class wa mainli jewish the jew were mainli middl class thei enjoi freedom of travel serv in the hungarian fascist armi in fronlin unit as offic and soldier their name were hungarian how wa eichmann to find them if thei were to be extermin the task wa not easi there were a million jew in hungari most of them resid the rest be refuge from other countri mani had heard about the fate of jew elsewher and were unlik to believ ani statement by nazi offici like elsewher the onli peopl who had the inform and the ear of the frighten jewish popul were the judenrat in thi case the judenrat comprsi mainli the zionist feder member without their help the ss with offic and less than men plu a few hundr hungarian polic could not have collect and control a million jew when thei did not even know their whereabout kastner and the other were left under no illus eichmann told joel brand on of the member of kastner s committe that he intend to send all hungari s jew to auschwitz befor he even start the expuls he told them clearli that all these jew will die a dai unless certain condit were met the committe face a simpl choic to tell the jew of hungari about their fate with neutral rumania where mani could escap be in most case a few hour awai or to collabor with the nazi by assist in the concentr process what would not have been believ when come from the ss sound quit plausibl when come from the mouth of the zionist leadership thu it is that most of the hungarian jew went quietli to their death assur by their leadership that thei were to be sent to work camp to be sure there ar thirti piec of silver in thi narr of destruct the train of promin which eichmann promis to kastner a promis he kept to the last detail for eichmann it wa a bargain allow jew to surviv as the price paid for the silent collabor over the death of almost a million jew there wa no wai in which the jew of hungari could even be locat not to sai murder without the full collabor of kastner and hi few friend no doubt the ss would hunt a few jew here and there but the scale of the oper would have been miniscul compar to the half million who di in auschwitz it is import to realis that kastner wa not an aberr like sai rumkovski in lodz kastner act as a result of hi strongli held zionist convict hi action were a logic outcom of earlier posit thi is instanc when he expos to the gestapo the exist of a british cell of saboteur palgi and senesh and persuad them to give themselv up so as not to disrupt hi oper at no point dure hi trial or elsewher did kastner deni that he knew exactli what wa to happen to those jew to conclud the role plai by zionist in thi period wa connect to anoth role thei could and should have plai that of alarm the whole world to what wa happen in europ thei had the inform but polit it wa contrari to their prioriti the prioriti were and still ar quit simpl all that further the zionist enterpris in palestin is follow whatev the price the live of individu jew and non jew ar secondari if thi process requir deal with fascist nazi and other assort dictatori regim across the world so be it
