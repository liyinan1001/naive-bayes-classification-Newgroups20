i never thought of cours that it would spill over into a bloodi tragedi becaus you just couldn t imagin it here we ve been live under the soviet govern for year and no on even consid such an idea possibl but i had been form my own opinion and in the presenc of authorit peopl i would often ask where is thi all lead do peopl realli not see what kind of situat is emerg here the russian ar flee sumgait there ar veri few of them left why is no on deal with thi what s go on and when it all happen on the th and th it becam clear that everyth had been arrang by someon becaus what els ar you to make of it if the first secretari of the citi parti committe is march ahead of the demonstr with an azerbaijani flag i wouldn t be sai thi now if i hadn t receiv person confirm from him later becaus when we were under guard in the sk club on the st he came to the club that muslimzad the women told me there he is there he is that s muslimzad i didn t believ the rumor that he had carri an azerbaijani flag i thought that thei were just fals rumor i went over to him and said ar you the first secretari of our citi parti committe he answer me ye and i ask him tell me did you realli march

that time we were try to contain the crowd of in baku that wa prepar for a massacr those ar hi exact word the on he said in the offic of the council of minist of the armenian ssr and now about the event themselv of cours it s pain to discuss them becaus it mai seem that it s not true to someon els variou rumor concern what happen ar make the round some ar true other aren t but unfortun there ar more true on than fals becaus it wa so horribl in our ag here in the space ag the ag of scienc the ag of progress i don t know if someon had told me thi stori if i were live in or around moscow i wouldn t have believ it why not becaus it wa realli a genocid it wa a massacr that s genuin what it wa for exampl on that dai the th i didn t know about the th becaus my husband and i were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bed on the th our neighbor come to our place and sai you re in bed you don t know anyth about it there wa a demonstr in town and after it thei were overturn armenian car and burn them thei were look into car and ask ar you an armenian if thei answer in armenian then thei turn the car over and burn it thi isn t made up the wife of the senior investig of the baku ministri of intern affair told us he wa return home from hi dacha with hi wife raisa sevastyanova she s my neighbor she immedi came and told li that thei had land right in the middl of it i don t know what to call it the cavalcad of automobil thei were stop he answer in azerbaijani thei let them go but thei made him honk the horn thei were kick up a fraca we didn t even believ it and i said certainli that didn t happen how can that be and she said muslimzad wa lead the crowd and the sputnik store wa complet smash becaus most of the salespeopl there ar armenian and when he saw that thei had start break the glass in that store he said don t break the shop window don t destroi state properti but do whatev els you want i didn t hear thi with my own two ear but it is a fact that the store wa torn up and the director of the store wa beaten for emploi armenian although he s an azerbaijani while we were talk all of a sudden right across from us sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and sai look there s a crowd out there and sure enough when we look out there we saw that the crowd had alreadi start wreck the neighbor build there wa an armenian famili there a woman and two girl thei live across from us i m sorri i don t know the build number or the peopl s name sinc we were in my husband s apart in microdistrict and i live in microdistrict no there wa aw loot go on there at the time the most hideou thing were go on there then on build there our wa attack twice onc wasn t enough for them thei return to the place where thei hadn t finish the armenian off if an azerbaijani famili dare to conceal armenian thei beat the azerbaijani too thei also beat russian if it wa russian do the hide becaus there were russian among them thei said so on televis there were peopl of variou nation but thei didn t tell us why there were peopl of differ nation becaus thei wouldn t have touch the azerbaijani if thei hadn t dare to stick up for the armenian and give them temporari shelter in their home at the time i saw thi from the window i wa there sevastyanova wa there and so wa my husband we went out onto the balconi and saw a televis fly off a balconi all kind of thing even a sofa then when it wa all down there thei burn it up then we saw the crowd and thei were all ooh at first i couldn t figur out what wa happen and later i told my husband lendrush l think thei re beat someon out there and he answer i don t know could be suddenli the crowd separ for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband had turn the other wai he didn t see it i saw a nake girl with her hair down thei were drag her she kept fall becaus thei were push her and kick her she fell down it wa muddi there and later other wit who saw it from their balconi told us thei seiz her by the hair and drag her a coupl of block as far as the mortgag bank that s a good block and a half or two from here i know thi for sure becaus i saw it myself then the crowd rush toward our build we were stand there and you can of cours imagin what we were feel were thei go to kill us or not and i also had the aw thought that thei might torment me the wai thei torment that woman becaus i had just seen that i ask my husband i gave him an ax and said you kill me first and then let them do what thei want with the corps but our neighbor it s true defend us thei said there aren t ani armenian in our entrywai go awai onli muslim live here disast miss us that time but at two o clock in the morn a crowd of about peopl approxim came back to our place my husband wa alreadi asleep he can sleep when he s upset about someth but i can t i wa stand run from balconi to balconi our power wa out i don t rememb for how long but it wa as though it had been deliber turn off there were no light whatsoev and i wa glad of cours i thought it wa better that wai but then i look and the crowd is at our balconi thi wa at in the morn the first time thei were at our build it wa and now it wa in the morn but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani wa awak and watch out there were human be among them too so she goe out with a pail of garbag as though she need to be take garbag out at two o clock in the morn she us it as a pretext and went toward those young peopl thei realli were youngster from my balconi you could see perfectli that thei were young azerbaijani boi thei spoke azerbaijani and when thei came up to her she said what do you want and thei answer we want the armenian famili that live here point toward the second floor with their hand she sai i alreadi told you we don t have ani armenian here now leav do you hear thi is an old muslim woman talk to you and grab the hand of on boi who wa try to walk around her and enter the build anywai and start push him awai and so thei seem to listen to her thei were all veri young thei start apolog and left that wa the second time death wa at our door i forgot to mention about on other apart a man name rubik live there i don t know him realli i knew hi daughter i mean i saw her around but we realli didn t know them but i do know that that gui who live on the fourth floor across from our entrywai went to chernobyl and work there for eight month to earn monei can you imagin what that mean he risk hi life to earn x amount of monei in order to better hi famili he bought new furnitur and wa get readi to give hi daughter s hand in marriag but ala everyth wa ruin by those creep and scoundrel thei threw everyth out the window and the rest we saw from our balconi how the neighbor on the left and right ran into the apart and carri off everyth that hadn t alreadi been smash or taken what is on to think of that it mean that the parent in those famili were in on it too unfortun i came to be of the opinion that it wa all organ and that everyth had been foreseen in advanc both the beat of the armenian and the strip of apart someth on the order of we ll move the armenian out and take over their apart i have work honestli my whole life you can check everyth about me i came as a patriot from china wait for night on end in front of the consul gener of the ussr i came to my homeland as a patriot becaus i knew that the parti and the komsomol were holi thing but when i saw in sumgait that there wasn t anyth holi about them that parti membership wa bought that komsomol member join onli for person gain that there were no ideal no idea god save me everyth wa be bought and sold i saw all of it and understood how thei could allow that crap to go on like it did i can t talk ani more about it the imag of that beat when i went out of my own apart thei pick us up under soviet armi guard thei had arriv from all over to suppress that gang not onli armenian but some russian famili and their children too came out of their apart and join us becaus no normal person who had seen that could stai there with the situat the wai it wa and what s interest is that when we left on the buse i rode and thought that at least on group of peopl for sure peopl would basic rise to the situat would have some compass for the armenian would somehow understand the injustic of what wa done but have analyz and weigh the whole thing onc i calm down have thought it all through i came to a conclus that is share by mani peopl if a lot of azerbaijani didn t want their armenian neighbor to be kill and that basic depend on that muslimzad he said that he had want to calm them down then is it possibl that he didn t have peopl at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minut go and announc it on televis citizen of sumgait take what you can into your hand let s protect our neighbor from thi massacr those crowd weren t such that there wa no control them basic thei were unarm thei didn t have firearm mostli thei had knive thei had all kind of metal part like armatur shaft sharpen at the end special rock differ to a degre that we notic them there aren t rock like those in sumgait soil thei were brought from somewher as though it were all special plan so as i wa sai i weigh it all out and if ani of our neighbor had want to defend us why wasn t it arrang it mean that the govern didn t want to do it when the crowd wa move from the citi parti committe to the sputnik what there wa no wai of inform baku no there wa no wai it turn out the crowd wa do violenc in our microdistrict i won t mention the thing i didn t see myself i ll onli talk about the thing i myself wit thei were in microdistrict begin at o clock in the even when i saw them from the other build and thei were somewher els until mid night or on o clock in the morn becaus at thei came back to our build thei hadn t complet finish make their predatori round of microdistrict when thei return to our build i told my husband lendrush now the polic ar probabl go to come my god now the author ar probabl go to find out and come to our aid well ala no there were to be no author not a singl policeman not a singl fireman not a singl ambul came while thei were rage as it turn out as we later found out begin on the might of the th there were dead peopl ruin apart and burn auto on car near the bu station it wa burn and overturn it wa probabl there about four dai everyon saw it and what went on in block those who live there know thei saw from their balconi how thei attack the soldier in the buse how thei beat those poor unarm soldier and how on that squar i can t rememb the name of it where there is that fork come from the bu station that intersect now i m upset and i can t think of the name there s a tall build there a stori and from the balconi there peopl saw that butcheri when the poor soldier wear onli helmet with shield and those unfortun club move against that mob and when thei fell those to year old boi ran up and us stone big heavi stone beat them to death on their head who could have guess that someth like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet govern the upshot is that thi republ ha not been under soviet control for a long time but no on want to pai ani attent or get involv if you were to go and ask at my work mani peopl would confirm that i tell the truth i ve been struggl for truth for five year there alreadi the five year that i work at the azerbaijani railroad some peopl there consid me a demagogu other who know what some think i m an adventur seeker and some a prankster but i want everyth to be right i would becom outrag how can thi be why is it peopl treat on anoth thi wai on a soviet railroad as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani properti or the properti of some magnat or some mafia if i want to i ll get you out of here if i want to i ll get rid of you if i want to i ll do someth els and there s a black market price for everyth in the most brazen wai a coach to moscow cost so much a coach on a local train cost so much onc when i wa complain to the head of the conductor s pool he had the nerv to tell me mayb you won t even believ thi but thi i m afraid i heard with my own ear tatyana just how long can you fight for someth that you know will never have ani effect you re alon against everyon so instead why don t you give more monei to the chief conductor and everyth will go fine for you i start to cry turn and left what els could i do where els could i go to complain i realiz that everyth wa useless and the root of the whole thing is that it all goe on and no on want to see it i file a written complaint and thei ground it into dust thei destroi it i still have a copi but what s the us when the gener procuraci got involv with the investig of the bloodi sumgait affair in addit to the inform about what i saw what i wa a wit to i gave testimoni about the mafia at the railroad thei accept my petit but i don t know if thei re go to pursu it or not becaus you ll excus me i no longer believ in the thing i aspir to the thing i believ in befor it s all dead thei just spit on my soul stomp on everyth physic and most import spiritu becaus you can lose belong that s nonsens that all come with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you your belief ar destroi it can be veri difficult to restor them i want to tell of on incid i just don t know at the time i wa in such a state that i didn t even take minor thing into account here is an exampl of cours it s not a minor on my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she ha a son valeri who is in the th grade in a school in microdistrict a boi vitali danielian i don t know hi last name goe to school with him or rather went to school with him i wa just sit in an apart try to make a phone call to moscow oh ye and there s on import detail when the massacr began for two to three hour the phone weren t work in armenian apart and later in sever russian and azerbaijani apart but the fact of the matter is that servic wa shut off you could not call anywher why again it mean it wa all plan how come servic is cut off for no reason and the light went off and those brat were rage as thei like thei weren t afraid thei ran about freeli thei that no on would slap their hand and no on would dare to stop them thei knew it now i m go to tell about the incid so thi littl vitali vitalik an armenian boi went to school with valeri thei were in the same class accord to what valeri and hi neighbor pal said at the time i wa in the same apart as thei were i sat at the phone wait for the call to be put through a mob attack the build where vitalik live so valeri ran to hi mother and said mamma pleas let me go to vitalik s what if thei kill him mayb he s still aliv mayb we can bring him here and save him somehow he s a nice gui we all like him he s a good person he s smart hi mother wouldn t let him go in tear she sai valeri you can t go becaus i am afraid he sai mamma we can get around the crowd we ll just watch just have a look thei made it through i don t know i think vitalik s parent live in microdistrict no and when thei got there thei made a superfici deduct know that balconi and door were be broken everywher that you could see from the street which were the armenian apart in the build thei went here and there and look and saw that the window were intact and so thei calm down but even though the window in that apart were not broken everyth insid wa total smash and vitalik lai there with a broken skull and hi mother and father had alreadi been murder littl vitalik didn t even know thei were dead so two week ago i don t know he wa in critic condit no mayb it wa longer we left sumgait on march spent some time in moscow and then we came to yerevan so it s been about a month alreadi it s so hard to keep all thi straight so valeri the next dai when he found out that vitalik s famili ha been kill and vitalik wa ling in the semashko hospit in baku valeri and hi classmat got togeth and went to visit him but thei wouldn t admit them tell them that he wa in critic condit and that he wa still in a coma thei cri and left have also found out that the girl i saw be kick and drag wa in that hospit too as it turn out she wa brought there in seriou condit but at least she wa aliv at the time when we got to the sk club we would see first on friend and then anoth throw ourselv into their arm and kiss them becaus you had wonder if these friend were aliv or not if those friend were aliv or not and when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the famili had live when you saw peopl you heard thing that made your hair stand on end if you publish everyth that happen it will be a hideou book a book of thing it is even difficult to believ and those two girl who were rape were entir black and blue the on at the sk thei know i m not ly that girlfriend came up to on of them and said what happen and she bare her breast and thei were complet cover in cigarett burn those rogu had put cigarett out on her breast after someth like that i don t know how you can live in a citi and look at the peopl in it now when we stai at the militari unit for a while thei provid well basic condit for us there the militari unit is locat in nasosni some six mile from sumgait and live there we met with a larger group of peopl there were about peopl at the unit you know there wa a point when i couldn t even go outsid becaus if you went outsid you saw so much heartbreak around you and when you hear the fals rumor ye by the wai fals rumor were spread in sumgait sai that the armenian around yerevan had destroi azerbaijani villag and raze them to the ground with bulldoz i didn t know whether to believ it or not and peopl who don t know ani better get the idea that it wa all done in reveng but when i arriv in armenia and wa in spitak and in spitak all those villag ar not onli intact but at that time had even been protect just in case thei were guard thei got better food than did the inhabit of spitak not a singl person there di and no on is plan to harm them around yerevan all the villag ar safe and unharm and the armenian didn t attack anyon but actual after an evil of the magnitud suffer in sumgait there could have been a feel of veng but no on act on it and i don t know why you sometim hear accus to the effect that the armenian ar guilti that it is thei who organ it rumor like that ar be spread in azerbaijan and if on old person sai it and ten young on hear it thei not onli perceiv it with their mind but with their heart too to them it seem that the older person is tell the truth for exampl on sai did you know that out of peopl kill by the wai origin thei said peopl but later thei found a nd were azerbaijani and on wa an armenian of cours i m upset but it s utterli imposs to discuss such thing and not becom upset sometim l forget thing but i know i want to return to the time when we were in the sk club across from the citi parti committe when i saw muslimzad in the sk club build i went to him to ask becaus i couldn t believ that he had march in the front carri a banner i alreadi mention thi and if i repeat anyth pleas excus me i ask him why did you do that and why ar you here now why did you come here to laugh at these women who ar strewn about on the floor the overcrowd there wa tremend it wa complet unsanitari and sever of the children were alreadi sick it s true the troop tri to make it livabl for us thei cook for us on their field stove and provid us with wonder food but the thing is that their main job wa to ferret out the gang that wa still at it everywher that wa continu it sordid affair everywher plu thei were never given ani direct order thei didn t know what thei were author to do and not to do and it wa onli on march at five o clock in the even that krayev himself the lieuten gener the citi command of sumgait wa given full author and told everyon over a microphon from an armor personnel carrier that now he could do what he want to do as hi heart advis him and reloc peopl to the militari unit but that s not what i want to talk about now muslimzad characterist tri to get me out of the sk build and take me to the citi parti committe which is across the squar from the club he took me by the hand and said citizen don t worri we ll go and have a talk in my offic i told him no after everyth you ve done i don t believ on iota of what you sai if i go to the citi parti committe i ll disappear and the trace of me will disappear too becaus you can t stand it when oh ye and there wa anoth interest detail from that meet it wa even veri funni although at the time i wasn t up to laugh he wa in a nice expens hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak i said oh why did you come here all dude up like a london dandi you smell of good perfum you re in your starch shirt and you have your expens hat on you came to ridicul the poor women and children who ar ly on the floor who ar alreadi get sick whose rel have di did you come to laugh at them and the on who wa accompani him an azerbaijani i don t know who he wa or what hi titl wa he quickli snatch the hat off muslimzad s head and hid it then i said my god we re not maraud we re not you we didn t come to you with the intent of steal well kill me kill me muslimzad sai to me but i m not guilti kill me kill me but i m not guilti and i sai ok fine you re not guilti have it your wai but give us an answer we re ask you where were you when thei were tortur and rape those poor women when thei were kill the children burn thing carri on outrag and wreck all those apart where were you then you know we didn t expect it we did not know what to do we didn t anticip that someth like that would happen in sumgait i start laugh and said it s truli funni he sai what could i do we didn t know what to do and i sai i m sorri but it ll be ridicul if i tell you the first secretari of the citi parti committe shouldn t march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over hi dead bodi that s what you should have done that s the wai it wa dure the war not a singl parti committe secretari compromis himself either he di or he led peopl into battl and what did you do you ran awai you left you hid you march with a flag becaus you were afraid excus my languag you fear for your own damn hide and when we ask you you tell us that you got confus and you ask me what you could have done that s right i told him the citi parti committe got confus all the parti committe got confus the polic got confus baku got confus thei all lai in a faint for two week and the gang ran the show with impun and if it weren t for the troop it wouldn t have been just two dai there wouldn t be a singl armenian left in sumgait for sure thei would have finish their bloodi affair becaus thei brazenli went up to some russian too the on who tri to sai someth to them and thei told them as soon as we finish with the armenian we ll come after you too and by the wai there wa a colonel who took us to the militari unit he wa the on with the light blue collar tab who flew in and two hour later arriv on an armor personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us to the militari unit and who later start move us from the militari unit we ask him what how what will come of us he openli said you know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang we ll finish that quickli you ll stai at the militari unit for the time be and we ll decid later the gener procuraci of the ussr arriv it consist of investig from all citi there were some from stavropol from everywher just everywher becaus the affair wa truli fright about thi by the wai comrad katusev spoke as everyon know he s the first deputi gener procur of the ussr when he gave us a speech from the armor personnel carrier at the militari unit by the wai he told us the honest truth becaus he couldn t not sai it becaus he wa still experienc hi first impress of what he had seen and he said there wa afghanistan and it wa bad but sumgait it s horribl and the peopl who dare to do such a thing will be sever punish in accord with our law and that s a quot then on mother throw herself at him her two son had di befor her veri ey and sai who will return my son who is go to punish the culprit thei tri to calm her down and he said in order for us to conduct a proper investig in order that not a singl scoundrel avoid respons you must help us becaus we don t know mayb there wa someon els in the gang who is now be conceal in home and mayb the neighbor know mayb someon saw someth don t be afraid write about it in detail so that you re not afraid everyon know that mani of you ar afraid have live through such horror thei think that if thei write the whole truth about let s sai their neighbor or someon els that thei will seek reveng later we re go to do it like thi we re go to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we don t need to know who wrote it the name of the peopl who write won t be made public but we need all the inform let each and everi on not be afraid let each write what is necessari who thei saw in that gang who made threat or shout threaten gibe about the armenian you must describ all of these peopl and put the inform into the urn two soldier and a major guard the urn and sure enough mani peopl peopl who didn t even want to write i know on woman who ask me she came up and said you as a russian the same thing won t happen to you as will happen to me so pleas i ll give you the inform and you pleas write it down for me so she wa afraid and there were a lot like her but later after katusev made hi speech she sat and wrote down everyth she knew and we threw it all into the urn now we don t know if it will be of ani us for a factual pictur will emerg from all that inform on person can lie but thousand can t lie thousand simpli can t lie you have to agre with that a fact is a fact why for exampl should someon sai that black is white if it is realli black the first deputi chairman of the council of minist of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov as i said wa in yerevan my husband and i were at the council of minist of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov wa present the on who had come to convinc the peopl of sumgait to return to their previou dwell to their old apart we ask for a meet with him and it wa grant when we went to see him he tri to behav properli veri polit delic but when the truth wa told right to hi face and when i ask him some of the same question i had ask muslimzad where were you person when thei were beat us now you re try to convinc us to return why didn t you think at the time that thei were slaughter us where it wa all lead he sai you re tell the truth let s not minc word you ve told me right to my face and i ll tell you straight i ll tell you the pure truth i wa gotten out of bed in the even the whole govern wa up includ me and we were restrain a crowd of about in baku but we never expect that in a citi like sumgait with it fine intern record such a thing could happen we expect it in baku i sai so that mean you expect it all the same why were you expect it and he sai you know it just happen that wai we were expect it in baku we were try to restrain it but in sumgait i sai fine you didn t know for the first three or four hour but then you should have known why did no on help us and he sai well ok we didn t know what to do and thing like that basic it wa the same stori i got from muslimzad later when he said you go on back the situat in sumgait is favor now everyth is fine the armenian ar friendli with the azerbaijani to thi l answer you know what i m speak with you as a member of a neutral nation i have never argu with armenian or with azerbaijani and i wa an eyewit you tell me pleas comrad mamedov i ask him what would you sai about thi honestli if you were be complet frank with us then he said ye i admit that i am honestli asham shame on the entir azerbaijani nation we have disgrac ourselv not onli befor the entir soviet union but befor the whole world becaus now the voic of america and all the other foreign radio station of variou hue ar brand us with all kind of rumor too and i sai there s noth to add to what realli happen i don t think it s possibl to add anyth more aw he sai ye i agre with you i understand your pain it is truli an unfortun occurr i repeat that he said unfortun occurr and then he suddenli rememb himself what he wa sai he had a pen in hi hand he wa fidget with it nervous and said oh excus me a tragedi realli i take thi to mean that he realli think it s an unfortun occurr and of cours he sai i understand that have gone through all thi you can t return to sumgait but it s necessari to cool down and realiz that all those peopl ar be tri and he even gave a detail which i don t know if it matter or not
