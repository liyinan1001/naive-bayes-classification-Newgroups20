have pass sinc soviet power wa establish and up to the veri last minut we could not conceiv of what happen in sumgait it will go down in histori i m particularli surpris that the mob wasn t even afraid of the troop thei even fought the soldier mani soldier were wound the mob threw fuel mixtur onto the armor personnel carrier set them on fire thei weren t afraid thei were so sure of their impun that thei attack our troop i saw the clash on februari near the airlin ticket offic right across from our build and that mob wa fight with the soldier the inhabit of some of the build also azerbaijani threw rock at the soldier from window balconi even cinder block and glass tank thei weren t afraid of them i sai thei were sure of their impun when we were at the neighbor and when thei were rob home near the airlin ticket offic i call the polic at number and said that thei were rob armenian apart and burn home and thei told me that thei knew that thei were be burn dure those dai no on from the polic depart came to anyon s aid no on came to help us either to our home even though perhap thei could have come and save us as we later found out the mob wa given free vodka and drug near the bu station rock were distribut in all part of town to be thrown and us in fight so i think all of it wa arrang in advanc thei even knew in which build and apart the armenian live on which floor thei had list the bandit you can tell that the oper wa plan in advanc thank of cours to our troop to the countri s leadership and to the leadership of the ministri of defens for help us thank to the russian peopl becaus the major of the troop were russian and the troop suffer loss too i want to express thi gratitud in the name of my famili and in the name of all armenian and in the name of all sumgait armenian for come in time and avert terribl thing wors would have happen if that mob had not been stop on time at present an investig is be conduct on the part of the ussr procuraci i want to sai that those bandit should receiv the severest possibl punish becaus if thei don t the tragedi the genocid could happen again everyon should see that the most sever punish is mete out for such deed veri mani bandit and harden hooligan took part in the unrest in the mass disturb the mob were huge at present not all of them have been caught veri few of them have been i think judg by the
