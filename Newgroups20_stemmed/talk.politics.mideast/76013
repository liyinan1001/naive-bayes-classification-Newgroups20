ottoman empir and the turkish republ and turkei and the holocaust turkei s role in rescu turkish and european jewri from nazi persecut shaw chair the undergradu interdepartment degre program in near eastern studi and ha organ the program for the studi of ottoman and turkish jewri he is affili with the g e von grunebaum center for near eastern studi editor how did you come to write these two book on turkei and european and turkish jew shaw basic i m an ottoman historian but i m also jewish i ve spent twenti five year studi ottoman histori and as time went along whenev i found materi on the ottoman jew i collect them but i never did anyth with them until a coupl of year ago when i suddenli realiz that wa the th anniversari of the jew be expel from spain and come to turkei then the sephard templ down on wilshir avenu invit me to give a seri of three lectur on ottoman jewri these lectur were greatli appreci and i becam motiv to undertak further research to develop a book the jew of the ottoman empir and the turkish republ thi book is quit differ from the work of most jewish historian who tend to look at the jew in ani countri more from the viewpoint of the jew and the jewish commun and reli mainli on jewish sourc i view my subject as an ottoman historian and i approach the jew of the ottoman empir larg from the point of view of ottoman societi us larg ottoman sourc after i finish thi book and sent it to the press i came across addit document relat to turkish jew dure world war ii in the complet book i had said that turkei had done a good deal to rescu the jew dure world war ii but i did not actual have mani detail then i found a batch of document in the foreign ministri archiv relat to action taken by turkish diplomat to help the jew befor and dure the holocaust it wa too late to add thi new inform to the book in press so i decid to write a second book i conduct further research mainli in the archiv of the foreign ministri in ankara and the turkish embassi and consul in pari the result wa the second book turkei and the holocaust which detail how turkei help rescu jew from the nazi how exactli did thei do thi the stori take place over a number of year the book present the materi in three part first of which deal with the period befor the holocaust when the nazi came to power in germani in thei immedi start dismiss jew and anti nazi german from univers hospit scientif institut and the like turkei at that moment wa just begin the process of reform it univers and it saw in these jew who were be fire from their posit in germani a good sourc of new talent to help modern the turkish univers within three month after the nazi start dismiss these jew turkei arrang to take mani of them in thei were brought to turkei and were given appoint as professor in the turkish univers as head of scientif institut and as medic personnel in hospit about to major jewish professor came to turkei in the s ernst reuter a german polit scientist spent the war year teach polit scienc in turkei after world war ii he wa mayor of berlin dure the berlin airlift fritz neimark a major german jewish economist came to turkei and help establish a modern school of econom in istanbul a man name reichenbach who wa rescu from the nazi by turkei and spent the war year in turkei eventu came to ucla where he becam a professor of philosophi other german jewish emigr engag in cultur activ in turkei on such wa karl ebert who had been a lead theatric produc in berlin until he wa expel by the nazi he went to turkei where he organ the turkish nation theater and the turkish nation opera compani in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book cover thi first phase when jew were be persecut in germani and rescu by turkei oddli enough the german emigr when thei were in turkei did not seem to think too badli of germani thei regard themselv more as german than jew and thei did not join in the anti nazi activ of the local turkish jewish commun i even found letter from the nazi repres to turkei prais these german jewish refuge for their work in promot the idea of german cultur even though these peopl had been persecut by the nazi and rescu by the turk thei share the nazi feel of aryan racial superior over the turk the second part of the book deal with the holocaust which began in when the nazi occupi franc in europ at that time and especi in franc there were about turkish jew thei had migrat to europ for variou reason from about the turn of the centuri onward most of them had settl in europ dure the turkish war for independ after world war i when greec wa threaten to overrun turkei the greek had persecut the jew throughout the nineteenth centuri and the jew fear what might happen to them if the greek took over in turkei mani jew fled to franc dure the s and s mani also abandon their turkish citizenship and becam french citizen suddenli the nazi invad franc in and start introduc all sort of anti jewish law the turkish jew soon found that it wa not worth veri much to be a french jew but that it wa worth a lot to be a turkish jew how so turkei remain neutral through most of world war ii it retain it embassi and consul in all the nazi occupi countri until it final enter the war on the side of the alli at the end of dure the war therefor turkei wa in a posit to defend it citizen against anti jewish measur and the action that turkish diplomat took form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomat who were station in franc in particular interven to protect jew of turkish citizenship from the nazi for those turkish jew who had retain their turkish citizenship there wa gener no problem if thei were arrest and sent to a concentr camp the turkish diplomat would commun with the command of the camp and other offici and sai in effect these peopl ar turkish citizen you can t do thi to them and the turkish jew would be releas if their busi were confisc the turkish diplomat would protest and the busi would be restor the nazi in gener want to keep the friendship of turkei thei hope to be abl to us turkei as a gatewai for an invas of the middl east and thei also want to obtain chromium and manganes from turkei in order to keep turkish friendship thei usual accept these intervent on behalf of turkish jew the turkish diplomat sometim went to the concentr camp to secur the releas of turkish jew at time thei even board train haul turkish jew to auschwitz for extermin and succeed in get them off the train most of the foreign jew were sent to a concentr camp at a place call dranci in pari and that s where most of the intercess by turkish consul took place the greater problem came with the turkish jew who had abandon their turkish citizenship and had becom french citizen the consul couldn t declar that these peopl were turkish citizen becaus thei were not my book includ photograph of jew line up in front of the turkish consul either to get passport to return to turkei or to get a restor of their turkish citizenship thi wa a bureaucrat matter so process the applic would take some time in the meantim it wa a real emerg becaus the nazi would arrest jew on the street for almost noth the nazi would even arrest them if thei had radio or telephon in their apart becaus radio and telephon were forbidden to jew to take care of these former turkish jew the turkish diplomat invent a document call gayri muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen the document said in effect thi person is a former turkish citizen who ha appli for the restor of hi turkish citizenship in the meantim we would appreci it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen the diplomat wrote the document in turkish and put their seal on it sinc the nazi could not read turkish on the whole thei accept these paper as certif of citizenship by thi mean the turkish diplomat were abl to rescu mani jew who had relinquish their turkish citizenship actual the nazi were of two mind about the turkish defens of jew on the on hand the nazi foreign ministri which want to retain the friendship of turkei wa in favor of accept these intervent on the other hand himmler and eichmann want all jew extermin at time himmler and eichmann were abl to prevail and some of the turkish jew were sent off to auschwitz befor the turkish consul could do anyth do you have statist on how mani turkish jew were rescu there were about turkish jew in europ befor world war ii about of whom were live in franc most of the inform in thi section of the book relat to the situat in franc i have publish the letter that the turkish consul sent to the nazi offici and the letter that came back in repli gener the nazi said that if the turkish consul would present document certifi that arrest individu ar turkish citizen and promis to send them out of franc the nazi would releas them from the concentr camp the turkish consul also organ special train to take turkish jew from nazi occupi territori back to turkei these train ran regularli in and the nazi gave the turkish jew visa so thei could pass out of nazi territori but the train were often held up by the nazi influenc govern of eastern europ croatia serbia and bulgaria becaus these govern realli didn t want the jew to escap as a result of the turkish consul effort about to of the turkish jew in franc were save anoth were sent off to auschwitz where most of them di the remain either escap across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern franc occupi by the italian who treat jew much better than the nazi did at the end of howev itali fell out of the war and that wa the end for those jew as well incident the turkish diplomat in nazi occupi greec also work to rescu jew in that countri the second part of your book then deal with turkish diplomat act to rescu jew of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecut ye and there is an asid i might add here in their intervent on behalf of turkish jew the turk cite their treati with germani which state that turkish citizen in german territori would be treat the same as german citizen in turkei on that basi the turk maintain that the nazi could not discrimin against turkish citizen who ar jew the nazi claim and the vichi govern agre that thei were not discrimin becaus thei were treat all jew equal turkei protest sai you ar divid our citizen accord to religion but the turkish constitut requir that all citizen be treat equal regardless of religion therefor you cannot singl out turkish jew american consul in pari by contrast accept the nazi argument and told american jew who were be persecut by the nazi that thei couldn t do anyth about it becaus the american jew were be treat the same as other jew the third part of the book take place in turkei which wa the princip center dure the holocaust for activ aim at the rescu of eastern european jew the kwish agenc an organ establish by jew in palestin to help resettl jew to palestin set up an offic in istanbul in under the leadership of chaim barla other jewish organ in palestin especi the kibbutz also sent repres to istanbul to set up headquart these group first tri to contact jew in eastern europ to find out what wa happen todai we know about the holocaust but at that time peopl didn t know what wa go on thei didn t imagin the nazi could do the thing thei were do and so the first step wa to get inform and the turkish govern let them us the turkish mail to send letter to their rel and friend in eastern europ the jewish organ found out what wa happen when thei receiv repli later on when the nazi began to intercept such letter the jew receiv assist also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who serv as the vatican repres in istanbul from to and later becam pope john xxiii as the vatican repres dure the war he us the facil of the cathol church to supplement what the turkish govern wa do to assist jewish agenc in contact jew in eastern europ with the cooper of the turkish govern these agenc then sent hard currenc food cloth and even railroad and steamship ticket to jew in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungari thei weren t abl to help much in poland becaus by then the nazi had wipe out almost all the polish jew whenev possibl the rescu agenc arrang for the jew to get out of eastern europ either by train through the so call orient express rout to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkei wa not eager for all these refuge to remain within it border dure the war becaus it wa be blockad and wa suffer terribl shortag of food and cloth the govern therefor facilit the movement of the non turkish jewish refuge from turkei to palestin either by the tauru express railroad through the mountain to syria and palestin or by small boat across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkei to palestin these effort were bitterli oppos not onli by the nazi but also by the british who did not want ani more jewish immigr to palestin becaus thei fear it would hurt their relat with the arab the british constantli pressur the turkish govern to stop thi traffic and send those jew back in a few case the turkish govern yield to british pressur did send the boat back for exampl in on incid the steamship struma with some jewish refuge from romania wa sent back by the turkish govern as a result of the intervent of the british ambassador when that ship wa sunk by a soviet submarin all were lost except on person nevertheless all told the turkish govern allow no fewer than eastern european jew to pass through turkish territori and move on to palestin dure the second world war the turkish author also provid these refuge with facil and monei and gave them permiss to send monei and food out of the countri mani of these jew who pass through turkei mai still be live in israel ye and their children but let s return for a moment to the first group the turkish jew who came from europ thei did not go on to palestin thei stai in turkei it wa the non turkish eastern european jew who pass through turkei en rout to palestin their stori is veri interest and you have rescu it from obscur mani studi have been made of the holocaust but most of them do not focu on the eastern european or middl eastern jew most of the scholarship ha center on the western european jew of whom million were massacr by the nazi my studi deal with a much smaller number of peopl i have tri to round out the pictur and i hope my book will persuad other scholar to undertak further investig in the histori of eastern jew when it come to number the german jew were also rel small in number most of the million slain were polish jew the rescu of eastern european jew mai not seem so signific compar with the total of million who were murder but it meant a lot to those who were save about three fourth of the book consist of document translat of mani document thei ar includ becaus the stori is not well known not onli ar peopl in the west unawar of the courag
