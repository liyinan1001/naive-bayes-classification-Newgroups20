just don t know everyon wa cry everyon onli the young peopl the men somehow manag to keep it togeth but the women were in a constant state of panic it seem to everyon that thei would come ani minut and kill and stab it seem clear that we had been gather togeth purpos like dure the war so that thei could burn the movi theater and there wouldn t be a singl armenian left then peopl went up to the attic i didn t see them i onli heard them becaus i wa ly down and couldn t get up i lai right on the stage we had some room there appar thei caught two peopl with either oil or ga i think thei want to burn the theater mayb someon saw them i didn t i wa in no condit to open my ey everyon wa suspici of everyon els thei would ask aren t you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewher i think you re an

the neighbor wouldn t take her in so she ran about the build until she found refug she wa pregnant and had two small children thi all continu on mondai in block a on the th when the troop were alreadi in the citi thei murder peopl thei overturn automobil and thei burn entir famili thei sai thei didn t even know for sure if the peopl were armenian or not i heard that the lezgin suffer too i m not sure myself i didn t see ani lezgin who had been injur thei burn car so it s veri difficult now to sai exactli who di and who didn t it wa veri difficult to identifi the corps or rather what remain of the corps after thei were dous in gasolin and burn it s all veri hard to imagin of cours i heard that mani peopl disappear without a trace from the btz plant two peopl includ a woman who work the night shift aunt razmella who also live in microdistrict thei were stop buse between baku and sumgait in the even peopl who had been visit baku were return to sumgait and peopl from baku were go home

brutal mind peopl thei stop the buse drag the armenian out and kill them on the spot i didn t see it myself but i heard that thei put them all in a pile so as to burn them later it wa hard to discern from the corps well you can t call them corps you had to figur out from the ash who it wa l heard that two fellow save two women on a student ira g if i m not mistaken she wa in the hospit a long time after that and she still can t figur out who save her she wa also brutal rape and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corps the fellow pull her out of that whole pile of corps put hi coat on her took her

hospit and sing a song in armenian and thei wrote the word down and i think he still ha that piec of paper becaus he sai that a lot of peopl now have that song the on she sang in the hospit where she lai in such bad shape thei couldn t find the gui who save her he left her in someon s apart and call the ambul she wa in such aw shape that probabl like me she couldn t rememb anyon s face i think that i knew on of the peopl who broke into our hous mayb i had talk with him onc but i receiv so mani blow everyth wa just knock out of my head i can t rememb to thi dai who he wa then it seem i saw the secretari of the director s parti organ where marina work she goe to school and work she goe to night school at azi and work by dai at the khimzashchita construct and instal administr i m the secretari of the komsomol organ at our administr and often met with the secretari of parti and komsomol organ we had joint meet i know them all i ve even talk with them and he i know is from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it becam obviou that mani of those peopl were azerbaijani born in armenia thei took me to variou polic station to the polic precinct and to the procuraci becaus the

thi stuff look me in the ey you re like a sister to me i took a look at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but thei were satisfi with my respons becaus i said

lyuda wa ly on the balconi the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we had all kind of box with dish in them the dowri for all three sister thei stole everyth in the apart leav onli small thing at that moment lyuda came to and start rememb everyth well see the face hear the voic two peopl were sai thei could burn the apart anoth sai why burn the apart when i ve got three kid and no place to live so thi gui wa in temporari hous he didn t have anywher to live he wa from sumgait thei were sure that thei would get the apart besid the neighbor were azerbaijani why should thei burn the apart thei might burn azerbaijani that s what thei said how did thei know there were azerbaijani there if thei just pick a place think that armenian live there we have a list of the resid for our part of the build our name is in there but how could thei know that azerbaijani live on the other side of the wall from us so thei didn t set fire to our apart i don t know i wa in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i wa outsid if someon had ask me what wa happen i would have said that a civil war wa go on well mayb not civil but probabl civil becaus when thei were beat me i open my ey and saw that all the neighbor were stand on their balconi and watch like at a free horror film so a civil war wa go on and onli the armenian were be fought if it were a world war or someth like that thei would have been fight everyon but thei onli fought us then i met some women from our build some azerbaijani thei ar cry thei tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen thei re ask me well i just don t know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happen to me i think that if it were the other wai around either i wouldn t have been abl to take it or i would have tri to avert it like that on azerbaijani woman did in front of our build a woman live there an aw dissip woman if you can call her a woman the dissip life she lead two armenian famili live there in her part of the build she came out on the balconi and saw what wa happen to me and start to scream and curs she came down to the entrywai and said you ll come in thi entrywai over
