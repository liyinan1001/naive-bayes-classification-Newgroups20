role in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuri klau schwarz werlag freiburg page dure the fifteenth centuri when the ottoman were struggl to reestablish themselv in the balkan there wa consider turmoil among the jewish commun in central and western europ even if the difficulti of the darker centuri immedi preced the fourteenth ar minim it is easi to understand the attract which ottoman life particularli when compar to life in europ held for the jew there is no wai to tell how mani jew left christendom for the realm of the rise muslim ottoman but with each account of persecut in or expuls from christian countri it is record that some jew fled to ottoman territori the regular of these report suggest that the ottoman were consid reason toler protector and that there wa a regular trickl of jewish famili move southward and eastward from western and central europ it is evid that the effect of plagu late crusad and the gener intoler and persecut of jew in christian europ result in the redirect of the whole focu of jewish life which for more than two centuri wa to be orient toward muslim east page in the second quarter of the fifteenth centuri the foremost offici in the edirn jewish commun wa rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the citi he wa the most import rabbi in the citi and the author of an import letter which tell us someth of the situat of the edirn jewri in the fifteenth centuri sarfati himself wa from christian europ and supposedli wrote thi letter at the behest of two recent arriv from there who upon see the prosper and freedom of the ottoman jew prevail upon him to write their european coreligionist appris them of the situat and urg them to migrat thi remark letter advis it recipi not onli of the pleasant condit in the ottoman domain but describ as well the eas of travel to palestin and the holi place an attract to those who would make a pilgrimag or choos to be buri there page the impress gain from the hebrew sourc is that the jew were firmli awar of the commun of interest which exist between them and the ottoman especi in comparison to relat with the christian of europ confirm of the common of interest between muslim and jew is also indic by the fact that european christian perceiv the jew as alli of islam and were well awar of muslim jewish cooper certainli the activ of import jewish financi and politician repres the ottoman govern abroad did not pass unnot european sourc ar the basi for much of our knowledg of their career in addit it appear that christian pirat plunder turk and jew their sworn enemi and that european consid the jew to be agent who regularli report to the ottoman there ar well known exampl of overt jewish support for the ottoman in the struggl against european power the two best known instanc of jewish support for the campaign ottoman ar the frequent cite instanc of the jewish contribut to the conquest of buda in the earli sixteenth centuri and of rhode we also have report of sympathi for the ottoman dure the sieg of chio an unpublish ottoman document show dramat the mutual interest which exist in some greek town page it is clear that throughout the sixteenth centuri it wa a gener accept fact that the interest of jew and muslim coincid frequent and all parti involv jew muslim and christian were awar of the situat page it seem that the relat between greek and jew were not particularli cordial the two group had littl in common few common interest and perceiv no common philosoph or religi tradit which could serv as the basi for cooper rather than enmiti if there wa ani identifi bond of good will which exist between religi commun in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuri it wa that between muslim and jew neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox page the gener impress of muslim jewish relat in the ottoman context dure the fifteenth and sixteenth centuri is on of commun of interest from the earliest time the ottoman seem to have welcom jew to their territori and to have found in the commun alreadi exist in place which thei conquer a cooper element the jewish respons to thi toler wa a steadi flow of jew from christian countri to ottoman domain page from the period befor we have onli a few indic that the ottoman jewish relationship wa well on the cours of amiti which would character it for year afterward but the liber of the ottoman in contrast to the intoler of the byzantin and the protect and the secur which the ottoman offer in comparison to condit elsewher leav littl doupt that even then both the ottoman and the jew recogn their mutual interest page it is imposs to sai how fundament the jew were in the success of the ottoman in rebuild istanbul or in ottoman mercantil success in the sixteenth centuri that thei plai an import role in both cannot be doupt it is also unclear whether thei were import enough to sai that the ottoman would not have experienc their great success without the jew and that no other group could have been found to serv the ottoman as well as did the jew it is howev unmistak clear that there ar few parallel in world histori to thi remark partnership between jew and the non jewish societi in which thei live we must conclud that the ottoman could probabl not achiev their success without a group perform certain task for them as well as the jew did certainli for the jew of the fifteenth and
