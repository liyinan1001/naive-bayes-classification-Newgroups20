not to harm her daughter she said do what you want with me just leav my daughter alon well thei did what thei want thei threaten to kill her daughter if she got in their wai now i would be surpris if the crimin had behav ani other wai that night it wa simpli bartholomew s night i sai thei did what thei would love to do everi dai steal kill rape mani ar surpris that those anim didn t harm the

becaus thei hadn t slept the night befor mayb for some other reason i don t know but thei hadn t been smoke and thei weren t drunk i m posit becaus someon who ha smoke will stop at noth he ha the urg to do and thei spoke in a cultur fashion with marina littl sister don t be afraid we won t harm you don t look over there where i wa you might be frighten you re a muslim a muslim woman shouldn t see such thing so thei were realli quit sober so we came out of that stori aliv each everi dai we have live sinc it all happen bear the mark of that dai it wasn t even a dai of those sever hour father

citi thi wa the th when the kill wa go on in block a and in other place then we were told that all the armenian were be gather at the sk club and at the citi parti committe thei took us there on the wai i ask them to stop at the matern home i want to take karina with me i didn t know what wa happen there thei told me don t worri the matern home is full of soldier more than mother to be so you can rest assur i sai well i won t rest assur regardless becaus the staff in there is capabl of anyth when i arriv at the citi parti committe it turn out that karina had alreadi been brought there thei had seen fit to releas her from the hospi tal decid that she felt fine and wa no longer in need of ani care onc we were in the citi parti committe we gave free reign to our tear we met acquaint but everyon wa somehow divid into two group those who hadn t been injur who were cloth who had brought a pot of food with them and so on and those like me like raya who were wear whatev had come their wai there were even peopl who were all made up doll up like thei had come from a wed there were peopl without shoe nake peopl hungri peopl those who were cry and those who had lost someon and of cours the stori and the talk were fly oh i heard that thei kill him what do you mean thei kill him he stai at work do you know what s happen at thi and such a plant talk like that and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian the teacher i know him veri well and respect him highli i ve known him for a long time thei had a small room well realli it wa more like a studi room we spent a whole night talk in that studi onc on march we heard that bagirov first secretari of the communist parti of azerbaijan ssr had arriv everyon ran to see bagirov what new he had brought with him and how thi wa all be view from outsid he arriv and everyon went up to him to talk to him and ask him thing everyon wa in a tremend rage but he wa protect by soldier and he went up to the second floor and didn t deign to speak with the peopl appar he had more import thing to do sever hour pass gukasian call me and sai lyudochka find anoth two or three we re go to make up list thei ask for them upstair list of the dead those whose whereabout ar unknown and list of peopl who had pogrom of their apart and of those whose car were burn i had about peopl in my list when thei call me and said lyuda your mamma ha arriv she s look for you she doesn t believ that you ar aliv and well and that you re here i gave the list to someon and ask them to continu what i wa do and went off the list wa imprecis of cours it includ grant adamian raya tovmasian s father who wa aliv but at the time thei thought him dead there wa engel grigorian s father and aunt cherkez and maria the list also includ the name of my girlfriend and neighbor zhanna agabekian on of the gui said that he had been told that thei chop her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmo movi theater we put her on the list too and cri but later it turn out that that wa just a rumor that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for krasnovodsk where thank god she wa aliv and well i should also sai that in addit to those who di that list contain peopl who were rumor miss or who were so badli wound that thei were given up for dead all the list were taken to bagirov i don t rememb how mani dead were contain in the list but it s a fact that when gukasian came in a coupl of minut later he wa curs and wa terribl irat i ask what s go on he said lyuda can you imagin what anim what scoundrel thei ar thei sai that thei lost the list of the dead piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committe of the communist parti of the ussr ha just arriv and we were suppos to submit the list to him so that he d see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedi whether it wa on or fifti thei told him that the list had disappear and thei should ask everyon who hadn t left for the khimik board hous all over again there were peopl on our second list i think that the number wa the on that got into the press and onto televis and the radio becaus that s the list that demichev got i rememb exactli that there were peopl on the list i had even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that wa onli a half of those that were on the first list he said lyuda pleas try to rememb at least on more but i couldn t rememb anyon els but there were more than dead of that i am certain the govern and the procuraci don t count the peopl who di of fright like sick peopl and old peopl whose live ar threaten by ani shock thei weren t regist as victim of the sumgait tragedi and then there mai be peopl we didn t know so mani peopl left sumgait between march and most of them left for smaller town in russia and especi to the northern caucasu to stavropol and the krasnodarsk territori we don t have ani inform on them i know that there ar peopl who set out for part around moscow in the period krestyanka woman farmer there wa a call for peopl who know how to milk cow and for mechan and driver and i know a whole group of peopl went to help out also clearli not on our list ar those peopl who di enter the citi who were burn in their car no on know about them except the azerbaijani who ar hardli like to sai anyth about it and there s more a great mani of the peopl who were rape were not includ in the list drawn up at the procuraci i know of three instanc for sure and i of cours don t know them all i m think of three women whose parent chose not to public what had happen that is thei didn t take the matter to court thei simpli left but in so do thei didn t ceas be victim on of them is the first cousin of my classmat kocharian she live in microdistrict no on the fifth floor i can t tell you the build number and i don t know her name then come the neighbor of on of my rel she live in microdistrict near the gift shop i don t know her name she live on the same land as the sumgait procur thei beat her father he wa hold the door while hi daughter hid but he couldn t hold the door forev and when she climb over the balconi to the neighbor thei seiz her by her braid like the azerbaijani were sai it wa a veri cultur mob becaus thei didn t kill anyon thei onli rape them and left and the third on i don t rememb who the third on wa anymor thei transfer us on march karina still wasn t herself ye we live for dai in the sk in the cultur facil and at the khimik thei live there and i live at the citi parti committe becaus i couldn t stai with karina it wa too difficult for me but i wa at peac she had surviv i could alreadi walk but realli it wa honest word that held me up thank to the social work i did there i manag to persever aleksandr mikhailovich said if it weren t for the work i would go insan he and i put ourselv in gear and took everyth upon ourselv someon had an infant and need diaper and free food and we went to get them the first dai we bought everyth although we should have receiv it for free thei were suppos to have been dispens free of charg and thei sold it to us then when we found out it wa free we went to krayev at the time fortun you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor all the more so sinc everyth wa still clearli visibl on our face krayev sent a captain down and he resolv the issu on march thei sent two investig to see us andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev the wai it work out in our famili thei had consid onli karina and me victim mayb becaus she and i wound up in the hospit mother and father ar consid wit but not victim shirokov wa involv with karina s case and bibishev with mine after i told him everyth he and i plan to sit down with the identikit and record everyon i could rememb while everyth wa still fresh in my mind we didn t work with the identikit until the veri last dai becaus the condit weren t there the investig group work slowli and did poor qualiti work sole becaus the situat wasn t conduc to work there weren t enough automobil especi dure the time when there wa a curfew and there were no typewrit for type transcript and no still or video camera i think that thi wa done on purpos we re not so poor that we can t suppli our investig with all that stuff it wa done especi to draw out the investig all the more so sinc the local author saw that the armenian were leav at the speed of light never to return to sumgait and the armenian had a lot to sai i came to an agreement with bibishev i told him myself don t you worri if it take us a month or two month i ll be here i m not afraid i look death in the ey five time in those two dai i ll help you conduct the investig he and i work togeth a great deal and i us thi to shelter karina i gave them so much to do that for a while thei didn t have the time to get to her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to be her self she wa have difficulti breath so we look for a doctor to take x rai she couldn t eat or drink for nine dai she wa nauseou i didn t eat and drank virtual noth for five dai then on the fifth dai when we were in baku alreadi the investig told me how long can you go on like thi well fine so you don t want to eat you don t love yourself you re not take care of yourself but you gave your word that you would see thi investig through we need you then i start eat becaus in fact i wa exhaust it wasn t enough that i kept see those face in our apart ment in my mind everi dai i went to the investig solitari confin cell and prison i don t know we were just everywher probabl in everi prison in the citi of baku and in all the solitari confin cell of sumgait at that time thei had even turn the drunk tank into solitari confin thu far i have identifi of the peopl who were in our apart mamma identifi

of what wa to come on the th i ll return to grigorian what he did in our apart i rememb that he beat me along with all the rest he spoke azerbaijani extrem well but he wa veri fair skin mayb that led me to think that thei had it out for him too but later it wa prove that he took part in the beat and burn of shagen sargisian i don t know if he particip in the rape in our apart i didn t see i don t rememb but the peopl who were in our apart who didn t yet know that he wa an armenian said that he did i don t know if he confess or not and i myself don t recal becaus i black out veri often but i

were robot carri out someon els s will becaus at the investig thei all said i don t understand how i could have done that i wa out of my head but we know that thei were won around to it and prepar for it that s why thei did it in the name of allah in the name of the koran in the name of propag islam that s holi to them that s why thei did everyth thei were command to do becaus i saw thei didn t have mind of their own i m not talk about their level of cultur sophist or ani higher valu no educ thei work have a slew of children without the mean to rais them properli thei crowd them in like at the temporari hous and appar thei were promis that if thei slaughter the armenian thei would receiv apart so off thei went mani of them explain their particip sai thei promis us apart among them wa on who genuin repent i am sure that he repent from the heart and that he just despis himself after the incid he work at a children s home an azerbaijani he ha two children and hi wife work at the children s home too everyth that thei acquir everyth that thei have thei earn by their own labor and wasn t inherit from parent or grandpar and he said i didn t need anyth i just don t know how i end up in that it wa like some hand wa guid me i had no will of my own i had no strength no masculin digniti noth and the whole time i kept repeat now you imagin that someon did the same to your young wife right befor your own ey he sat there and just wail but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat wa not detain he perform a marvel disappear act but i think that thei ll get onto him thei just have to work a littl becaus that vadim that boi accord to hi grandfath is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do how to cover hi track he wa constantli exchang jacket with other boi he knew and those he didn t either and other thing as well and chang himself like a chameleon so thei wouldn t get onto him but he wa detain that on in the eskimo dogskin coat wa at the gambarian after aleksandr gambarian wa murder he came in and said let s go enough you ve spill enough blood here mayb karina doesn t know thi but the reason thei didn t finish her off wa that thei were hope to take her home with them i heard thi from aunt tanya and her son the kasumov who were in the courtyard near the entrywai thei like her veri much and thei had decid to take her to home with them when karina came to at on point she doesn t rememb thi yet thi the neighbor old me and she saw that there wa no on around her she start crawl to the entrywai thei saw that she wa still aliv and came back thei were alreadi at the third entrywai on their wai to the gambarian thei came back and start beat her to finish her if she had not come to she would have sustain lesser bodili injuri thei would have beat her less an older woman from our build aunt nazan an azerbaijani all but lai on top of karina cry and plead that thei leav her alon but thei flung her off the woman s grown son were right nearbi thei pick her up in their hand and led her home she howl and cri out loudli and swore god is on earth he see everyth and he won t forgiv thi there wa anoth woman too aunt fatima a sick ag woman from the first floor she s alreadi retir mountain dweller and azerbaijani too have a custom if men ar fight thei throw a scarf under their feet to stop them but thei trampl her scarf and sent her home to trampl a scarf is tantamount to trampl a woman s honor now that the investig is go on now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to be ourselv a littl i think about how could these event that ar now call the sumgait tragedi happen how did thei come about how did it start could it have been avoid well it s clear that without a signal without permiss from the top leadership it would not have happen all the same i m not afraid to sai thi the azerbaijani let other worthi peopl take no offens the better repres of their nation let them take no offens but the azerbaijani in their major ar a peopl who ar kept in line onli by fear of the law fear of retribut for what thei have done and when the law said that thei could do all that like unleash dog who were afraid thei wouldn t have time to do everyth thei threw themselv from on thing to the next so as to be abl to get more done to snatch a bit more the smell of the danger wa alreadi in the air on februari you could tell that someth wa go to happen and everyon who had figur it out took step to avoid run into those gang mani left for their dacha got plane ticket for the other end of the countri just got as far awai as their leg would carri them februari wa a saturdai i wa teach my third class the director came into my classroom and said that i should let the children out that there had been a call from the citi parti committe ask

that wa enough a portion of the peopl on the squar took off run in the direct of the factori toward the begin of lenin street we stood there about an hour then the director of school spoke he gave a veri nationalist speech he said brother muslim kill the armenian thi he repeat everi other sentenc when he said thi the crowd support him stormili whistl and shout karabagh he said karabagh ha been

must be elimin from time immemori muslim have cleans the land of infidel armenian from time immemori that s the wai natur creat it that everi to year the azerbaijani should cleans the land of filth by filth he meant armenian i heard thi befor that i hadn t been listen to the speech close mani peopl spoke and i stood with my back to the podium talk shop with the other teacher and somehow it all went right by it didn t penetr that in fact someth seriou wa take place then when on of our teacher said listen to what he s sai listen to what idioci he s spout we listen that wa the speech of that director befor that we listen to the woman s speech right then in our group there were nine of us the mood chang and the subject of convers and all school matter were forgotten our director of studi for whom i had great respect he s an azerbaijani befor that i had consid him an upstand and worthi person if there wa a need to obtain leav we had ask him he seem like a good person so he tell me lyuda you know that besid you there ar no armenian on the squar if thei find out that you re an armenian thei ll tear you to piec should i tell them you re an armenian should i tell them you re an

them after that when we were walk the buse weren t run and a crowd from the ralli ran nearbi us thei had appar gotten all fire up it must have becom too much for them and thei want to seek vengeanc immedi so thei rush off i wasn t afraid thi time becaus i wa sure that the other teacher wouldn t sai that i wa an armenian to make it short we reach home then karina told of how thei had been at the movi and what had happen there i start tell of my experi and again my parent didn t understand that we were in danger we watch televis as usual and didn t even imagin that tomorrow would be our last dai that s how it all wa at the citi parti committe i met an acquaint we went to school togeth zhanna i don t rememb her last name she live abov the housewar store on narimanov street she wa there with her father for some reason she doesn t have a mother the two of them were at home alon while her father held the door she jump from the third floor and she wa lucki that the ground wa wet and that there wasn t anyon behind the build when she went out on the balconi there wa no on there thei were all stand near the entrywai that build wa also a lucki on in that there were no murder there she jump she jump and didn t feel ani pain in the heat of the moment a few dai later i found out that she couldn t stand up she had been injur somehow that s how peopl in sumgait save their live their honor and their children ani wai thei could where it wa possibl the armenian fought back my father s first cousin armen m live in block thei found out by phone from on of the victim what wa go on in town the armenian in that build all call on anoth immedi and all of them arm themselv with ax knive even with musket and went up to the roof thei took their infant with them and their old women who had been in bed for god know how mani month thei got them right out of their bed and took everyon upstair thei hook electr up to the trap door to the roof and wait readi to fight then thei took the daughter of the school board director hostag she s an azerbaijani who live in their build thei call the school board director and told her that if she didn t help them the armenian on the roof to escap aliv and unharm she d never see her daughter again i m sure of cours that armenian would never lai a hand on a woman it wa just the onli thing that could have save them at the time she call the polic the armenian made a deal with the local polic to go into town two armor personnel carrier and soldier were summon thei surround the entrywai and led everyon down from the roof and off to the side from the armor personnel carrier wa a crowd that wa on it wai to the build at that veri moment into block that s how thei defend themselv i heard that our neighbor roman and sasha gambarian resist thei re big strong gui their father wa kill and i heard that the brother put up a strong defens and lost their father but were abl to save their mother on of the neighbor told me that after it happen when thei were look for the crimin on march to and detain everyon thei suspect peopl hid peopl in our entrywai mayb peopl who were injur or perhap dead the neighbor themselv were afraid to go there and when thei went with the soldier into our basement thei ar suppos to have found azerbaijani corps i don t know how mani even if thei had been wound and put down there after two dai thei would have di from loss of blood or infect that basement wa fill with water i heard thi from the neighbor and later when i wa talk with the investig the subject came up and thei confirm it i know too that for sever hour the basement wa us to store object stolen from our apart and our neighbor carri out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself pose as on of the crimin everyon wa take hi own share and the neighbor took hi too and carri it home and when we came back when everyth seem to have calm down he return it sai that it wa the onli thing of our he had manag to save raya s husband and father defend themselv the trdatov defend themselv and so did other armenian famili to be sure there were azerbaijani victim although we ll never hear anyth about them for some reason our govern doesn t want to sai that the armenian were not just victim but that thei defend the honor of their sister and mother too in the tv show pozitsiya viewpoint a militari man an offic said that the armenian did virtual noth to defend themselv but that s not import the truth will come out regardless so that s the price we paid those three dai for three dai our courag our braveri and our human wa test it wa those three dai and not the year and dozen of year we had live befor them that show what we ve becom what we grew up to be those three dai show who wa who on that i will conclud my narr on the sumgait tragedi it should be said that it s not over yet the trial ar still ahead of us and the punish receiv by those who so violat us who want to make us into nonhuman will depend on our posit and on the work of the investig the procuraci and liter of everi person who lent hi hand to the investiga tion that s the price we paid to live in armenia to not fear go out on the street at night to
