subject ten question to isra dear shai in the answer to my first question concern the nonexist of isra nation your answer conflict with inform i have receiv from other quarter accord to which there ar two distinct categori of classifi isra citizenship ezrahut and nation le um the former is us on passport etc and the later for daili identif in isra societi i am told that peopl in israel have to carri their id card at all time and present them at mani public place almost everi dai these id card make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab you maintain that thi mainli becaus of religi servic provid but do you realli believ that thi is the reason could you provid evid that thi is the case and that it serv no other purpos a number of point you ar make assumpt about the manner in which the card ar us true by law all resid citizen and tourist must carri a form of identif with them for citizen the standard id is the id card the purpos thi serv on a daili basi wherein thei ar present at public place is for the purpos of identifi the bearer thi take place in bank cash check post offic regist mail and such etc quit frankli it wa rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activ more than onc per week there is no law or requir that forc peopl to wave their id card in public furthermor none of the servic i outlin discrimin against the bearer in ani manner by have access to thi inform the onli case that i can think of in which the le um field might be taken into account is dure interact with the polic base upon the scenario in gener though arab citizen ar clearli recogniz as ar non arab your argument therefor becom moot unless you can provid an exampl of how thi field is be us to discrimin against them offici in the answer to my second question concern the fact that israel ha no fix border you state that israel s border were shape and reshap by both war and peac accord to what i read the first zionist in the begin of the centuri had plan for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan i also read that it wa the express wish of ben gurion to not declar israel s border when israel wa establish as thi might restrict israel s opportun for later expans israel often claim it right of exist on the fact that jew live there year ago or that god promis the land to them but accord to biblic sourc the area god promis would extend all the wai to iraq and what were the border in biblic time which israel consid proper to us todai final if israel want peac why can t it declar what it consid it legitim and secur border which might be a base for negoti have all the abov fact in mind on cannot blame arab countri to fear isra expansion as a number of war have prove i take issu with your assert i think that arab countri do know that thei have noth to fear from isra expansion militarili israel is not capabl of hold onto larg tract of land under occup to a hostil arm and insurg popul for a sustain period of time as is the intifada is heavili tax the isra economi proof of thi can be seen in the isra withdraw from lebanon isra troop pull back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minim strip need to keep town out of rang of katyusha missil fire public opinion in israel ha turn toward settl the intifada via territori concess the israel public is suffer from battl fatigu of sort and the gov t is awar of it with regard to border let me state the follow i mai not agre with the manner in which negoti ar be held howev the crux of the matter is that everyon either make or refrain from state a start posit the arab parti have call for total withdraw and a return to pre border if israel were to state larg border the negoti might never get under wai if israel were to state smaller border then the arab countri might try and forc even smaller border dure the negoti i think that leav the matter to be settl by negoti and peac treati is infinit more realist and sensibl your answer to my third question is typic of a stalinist public offici i don t think your answer is honest you refer me to vanunu s revel about israel s nuclear arsen without evalu the truthful of hi revel now if he said the truth then why should he been punish and if he li why should he be punish i would appreci more honesti your statement is typic of the simpl mind naiveti of a center for polici research whether or not all of vanunu s revel were true ha no bear on the fact that some were for disclos state secret after have sign contract and form with the understand that said secret ar not to be made public on should be punish as to which were and which weren t i am under no moral oblig to disclos that quit the revers in fact he wa taken to court tri and found guilti you mai take issu with a number of thing but clearli you have no understand of the concept of secret of state someth which everi democrat govt ha somebodi provid an answer to the fourth question concern hidden prison in isra prison he post an articl from ma ariv document such case it seem that such prison do exist in israel what do you think about that i notic that he wa document the fact that such prison could exist more than he document the fact that thei do exist the clu note which you evid did not pai attent to that thei know of no such report or case i am sorri to tell you but in a countri of mill as tightli knit as israel even if the matter of the arrest wa not made public within a rel short time frame most peopl would know about it my own feel ar that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issu allow a delai of x hour thi would be grant onli if a judg could be convinc that an announc would caus irrepar harm to the ongo investig you impli that my question show bia and ar formul in such a wai to cast aspers upon israel such term have often been us by the soviet union against dissid thei call the soviet union into disreput if my question ar not disturb thei would not call forth such hyster answer my question ar clearli provoc but thei ar meant to seek fact i would be veri happi if you could convinc me that what i am told about israel were just fabric but ala you have fail to do so i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discuss thi is a sign of weak not of strength well i am sorri to sai that your question ar slant such question ar often term tabloid journal and ar not disturb becaus thei avoid ani attempt at object such question were often us dure the mccarthi era as a basi for the witch hunt that took place then to us your own exampl these question might have been lift from the format us by stalinist prosecutor that were look for small bit of evid that thei could distort and portrai as a larger and dirtier pictur my answer were not ani more hyster than the question themselv the problem is not that the q s were provoc it wa that thei were select in their fact seek you fall into the same categori of those who seek ye no answer when the real answer is of sort i suspect that as long as the answer to these question is not an unequivoc no you would remain unsatifi and choos to interpret them as you see fit a sign of strength is the abil to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalist who onc advoc cull wolv becaus of the cruelti to deer onli to find that thei had broken the food chain and wreak havoc upon the veri environ thei sought to protect the color blind you exhibit is a true sign of weak i hope you will muster the courag to seek the full truth ditto shai gudai stealth bomber os softwar engin think machin corp the
