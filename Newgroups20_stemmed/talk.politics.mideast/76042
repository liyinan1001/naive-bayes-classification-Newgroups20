subject re armenia sai it could shoot down turkish plane in articl apr kpc com henrik quayl kpc com write in articl mucit apr vein cs rochest edu mucit cs rochest edu bulent murtezaoglu write henrik countri turk and azeri consistantli want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan bm gimm a break capit letter or not the abov is pure nonsens it bm seem to me that short sight armenian ar escal the hostil henrik again armenian in karabakh ar simpli defend themselv what do henrik want them to do lai down their arm and let azeri walk all over them new report i ve seen sai otherwis both locat and motiv wise cap don t chang fact bm while hope that turkei will stai out stop and think for a moment bm will you armenia doesn t need anyon to drag her into the conflict it bm is a part of it henrik armenian knew from the begin that turk were fulli engag henrik train azeri militarili to fight against karabakhi armenian so should i at thi point break into cap and start talk about defens etc i don t know how fulli engag turkei is wa though henrik the karabakhi armenian who have live in their homeland for henrik year cut off from armenia and given to azeri by stalin ar the henrik on directli involv in the conflict thei ar defend henrik themselv against azeri aggress bm huh you didn t expect azeri s to be friendli to forc fight with them bm within their border henrik well histori is sad rememb those ar reloc azeri into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regim so i hear thi justifi bloodsh n year after the fact henrik at last i hope that the u s insist that turkei stai out of the henrik karabakh crisi so that the repeat of the cypru invas will never henrik occur again bm you re not plai with a full deck ar you where would turkei invad henrik it is not up to me to specul but i am sure turkei would have step henrik into armenia if she could why would turkei do that do you not realiz that thi is a local clash that turkei never wish to see happen turkei ha other plan for region like econom reviv co oper etc good stuff in other word i d be happi to bicker with armenian over trade barrier and such on usenet rather than who kill whom in what wai which i detest do and wouldn t do bm ar you throw the cypru buzzword around with s c g in the header bm in hope that the greek netter will jump the gun henrik absolut not i am mere try to emphas that in mani henrik case histori repeat itself even if on bui into your implicit premis the sane thing to do would be to try not to provok turkei as wa done in if there d been a democrat govern instead of a bunch of idiot in athen at the time everybodi would have stai home with their famili i have no wish to go into the cypru quarrel but i suspect what i ve said is not onli accur but also palat to all parti involv bm ye inde turkei ha the militari prowess to interven what she wish bm she had howev is the diplomat power to stop the hostil and bring bm the parti to the negoti tabl that s hard to do when armenian bm ar attack azeri town henrik so let me understand in plain word what you ar sai turkei henrik want a peac end to thi conflict not so what do you think we want war death and destruct henrik i will believ it when i see it no if you allow yourself to believ it you just might see it henrik now as far as attack what do you do when you see a gun point henrik to your head do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef fat chanc thi kind of childish rhetor doesn t help anth henrik do you rememb what azeri did to the armenian in baku all the henrik barberian act especi against mother and their children i mean henrik burn peopl aliv now some azeri will come out and give a descript of similar stuff perpetr by armenian on should re hash stuff like thi often to keep the hatr aliv right bm armenian leader ar lack the statesmanship to recogn the bm futil of arm conflict and convinc their nation that a compromis that bm lead to stabil is much better than a militari fait accompli that s bm go to caus incess skirmish henrik armenian in karabakh want peac and their own republ thei ar henrik not ask much thei simpli want to get back what wa taken awai henrik from them and given to azeri by stalin well thei obvious aren t get anywher with their current method of ask not veri peac i d sai bm think of or year down the line both of the newli independ bm countri need to develop econom and neither on is go to wipe bm the other out these peopl will be neighbor would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minim henrik don t get me wrong i also want peac solut to the henrik conflict but until azeri realiz that the armenian in henrik karabakh will defend themselv against aggres i don t know if you want a solut or just want to exchang slogan peac isn t what s happen right now furthermor what s happen right now isn t condus to peac you can spend dai and night rave about how right the armenian posit is and i m sure there ll be other who d be happi to talk to you by argu the other side if entrench posit lead to war and if peopl want peac than thei should sit down and talk about a compromis armenia isn t strong enough to exercis the we think we re right and we have the bomb so we ll do whatev we want so there style of foreign relat ye you can type stalin in cap and give on side atroc stori etc but for peac you need to be will to talk to the other side you person can choos not to do that of cours thi be just usenet the peopl in power shouldn t be so childish bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strike bm your fanci on the map is cost the local armenian dearli in term of bm their blood and futur henrik again you ar take differ turn armenia ha no intens henrik to grab ani land from azerbaijan the armenian in karabakh henrik ar simpli defend themselv until a solut is set azeri s would disagre with you on thi and the map i ve seen support what thei d be sai it doesn t seem like that a solut will be reach in thi manner bm it s easi to be comfort abroad and propagand bm crazi to have your feel about turk tickl the armenian bm in armenia and n k will be there with the same peopl you seem to hate bm as their neighbor for mayb year more the sooner there s peac in bm the region the better it is for them and everyon els i d push for bm compromis if i were you instead of hit the cap lock and spread bm inflammatori half truth henrik it is not up to me to decid the peac initi i am absolut henrik for it it didn t look it when i read your post it would seem to me that if you can spew mi inform about a boogei man you can also talk about how on might avoid the nasti fair henrik but in the meantim if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wipe out such as the case in the era of of henrik the armenian massacr you don t realiz i can sai the same thing about the turkish massacr ye boi and girl let s alwai talk about how bad and nasti thing were let s do that so we re overwhelm by anger and let s do that so our kid will also be hate sound crazi doesn t it don t do it then bm
