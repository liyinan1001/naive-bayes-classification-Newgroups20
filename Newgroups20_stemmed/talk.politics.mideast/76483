israel ha repeatedli state that it will leav lebanon when the lebanes govern can provid guarante that israel will not be attack from lebanes soil and when the syrian leav not accept syria and lebanon have a right to determin if thei wish to return to the situat prior to the french invas where thei were both part of the same mandat territori read coloni israel ha no right to determin what happen in lebanon invad anoth countri becaus you consid them a threat is precis the wai that almost all war of aggress have start is israel s occup of the west bank gaza and golan temporari the three ar veri differ issu israel ha state repeatedli that it will not give up the whole golan but mai be will to give part of it to syria as part of a peac agreement again territori expans by forc israel ha alreadi annex area taken over in the war these area ar not occupi but disput sinc there is no legitam govern bodi citizenship wa given to those resid in annex area who want citizenship the un defin them as occupi thei ar recognis as such by everi nation on earth exclud on small caribean island israel should keep control of part of the west bank imho the part that should be kept ar the westernmost mountain ridg which contain few arab town and mani suburb as well as overlook the citi of tel aviv the eastern mountain ridg should be abandond thi is where most of the arab live and it is less militarili relev israel should also maintain a presenc in the jordan vallei so the adam think that peac is possibl with continu occup and a continu militari presenc that is a complet unsustain situat becaus the usa is bankrupt and simpli cannot afford to financ the isra ecconomi ani more there is no monei for such an occup if so for those of you who support it why were so mani settler move into the territori if it is not temporari let s hear it there ar a number of reason for peopl to move thei were not move but chose to move into disput area note that sinc these move were made by free will human be not settler i will address two aspect of your question why the govern would allow or encourag them to move and second why thei did move thei were move in as part of a deliber polici to prevent the return of the occupi territori machiavelli describ the reason in the princ the clear intent wa to creat a constitu which the likud beleiv could not be depriv of the land stolen from the indigen popul the pretext under which the settler aquir land wa through the redefinit of much land us in common as public land the assert that the villag common on which the villag depend for food belong to an invad simpli becaus no individu ha titl is clearli an excus when the land is us to build a condominium for alien brought in to occupi the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the geneva convent which stipul that land us in occupi territori must not be chang no amount of self justifi on the part of likud and hard linner appologist will chang the fact that the major of world govern and all of those that actual have ani power have condemn thi practic the govern had a number of reason for encourag peopl to move across the green line thei includ secur and polit the first reason wa secur a larg jewish presens make it difficult for terrorist to infiltr a jewish settlement also act as fortress in time of war theyu also ar a liabil we ar talk about civilian encamp that would last no more than hour against tank a second reason wa polit creat settlement brought the arab to the negoti tabl had the creation of new town and citi gone on anoth sever year there would be no place left in israel where there wa an arab major there would have been no land left that could be call arab don t fool yourself it wa the gulf war that brought the isra to the negoti tabl onc their us backer had a secur base in the gulf thei insrtruct shamir to negoti or els if the creation of settlement had gone on ani longer the usa would have cut the monei suppli the fact that there ar a hunder thousand jew in place chang the face of ani peac settlement and restrict what land can be given awai not at all thei can chose to live in an arab state or return to israel some of the communit creat were religi thei built their neighborhood in area where there were jew until the riot of the s and s there ar commun like thi in hebron gaza and all over there ar also commun built near religi site the exist of a comun doe not give the right for anoth countri to annex territori not in bosnia not in the west bank the point is there ar mani reason peopl move over the green line and mani reason the govern want them to whatev statu is negoti for disput territori it will not be an all or noth deal new boundari will be drawn up by negoti not be the result of a war unless the new boundari drawn up ar those of there will be no peac araffat ha preciou littl author to agre to anyth els the real issu is not the land treati but the trade treati sinc the palestinian will remain heavili depend on israel indefinit it is thi that will be the guarantor of peac anoth factor will be the return of land confisc by the isra state within israel and the dismantl of the shadow structur which allow discrimin against non jew within what is nominali a secular state the ironi is that in return for a guarante that the palestinian state ha a non descrimin law in order to protect the remain settler the isra state is go to be forc inot the same posit thi will mean outlaw of discrimin such as that which prevent arab from bui or us much of the land phill hallam baker
