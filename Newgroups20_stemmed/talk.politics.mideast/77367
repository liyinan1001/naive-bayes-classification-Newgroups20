correspond and from commentari by member of the long establish ar armenian american commun azeri view on thi disput have ar appear rare if at all in the western new media therefor let me ar present washington report reader with some basic truth about the ar origin of the conflict dure the past two year if on read all the commentari on the subject a small minor of the writer have been armenia or azeri the follow should be interest ar armenian leader claim that azerbaijan wa the first to oppress and ar expel the armenian minor from the azerbaijani republ actual ar the initi to banish the azeri minor and convert the armenian ar republ into a homogen state began in the winter of ar when azeri were driven out of armenia follow that move ar there were massacr of armenian in the azerbaijani citi of sumgait ar in februari and two year later in baku in januari thi not true other than simpli check the newspap i will quot from an independ human right report in the pax cristi netherland septemb page we read by mid novemb mani incid took place in sever place in azerbaijan the apf azeri popular front challeng the communist parti for power after ten dai the author came in with tank to reimpos their power in nakhitchevan the last armenian villag were deport in ganja armenian were attack and kill all armenian inhabit fled the citi between novemb and decemb refuge from ganja arriv in armenia while all azeri in armenia were chase awai in thi part of the world februari start of organ anti armenian pogrom in azerbaijan come befor novemb and decemb of ar azeri parliamentari committe have compil evid indic that ar both event were inspir from moscow to secur russian imperi rule ar in the transcaucasu accord to the roman principl of divid and ar rule similar conspiraci ar evid throughout the five year ar histori of the conflict it is interest that the azeri kill burnt rape the armenian but the perpetr blame russian and armenian themselv on other occas ar each time the parti have been about to reach an agreement in ar zheleznovodsk moscow tehran rome geneva and alma ata an ar invis hand provok further bloodsh those interest in ar maintain the azeri armenian conflict as well as the georgian ar turmoil ar imperialist forc in russia and probabl in iran incorrect when were the peopl of nagorno karabakh ever involv in an agreement never until azerbaijan sit down with the armenian of nagorno karabakh there will never be an end to thi conflict ar the armenian offens last spring creat more than new azeri ar refuge from the captur town of upper and lower karabakh and ar adjac rural district todai azeri refuge throng the ar citi of baku and environ provid more problem for the newli ar elect popular front govern which is oppos by the rigidli ar nationalist nation independ parti it s call war if the azerbaijani didn t try to deport and allow the armenian of nagorno karabakh to live in their wai keep their armenian cultur these armenian would not have had to defend their exist the azeri should not have assum that armenian were go to roll over and plai dead ar how can a western style democraci surviv in a small muslim countri ar where million of the million inhabit ar unemploi in the ar absenc of ani intern effort to help azeri refuge as kurdish ar and bosnian refuge have been help how can the azeri govern ar reject the demand of these exil to recaptur their land home and ar possess the azeri govern should have thought about such thning befor thei attempt to depriv armenian of land home and possess ar such simpl realiti must be understood in the west ar misunderstand caucasian polit lead both western and russian ar public opinion to imagin a perman and therefor irrevers ar ethnic and religi rivalri in the caucasu true and you dr alec rasizad should practic what you preach ar i think western reluct to interfer deriv from thi idea ar meanwhil continu of the war could draw both eastern and western ar state into the conflict through activ of variou secur ar allianc these includ on the armenian side the moscow led ar commonwealth forc under the tashkent mutual secur pact sign ar mai on the azeri side should turkei get involv as the ar guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomi through the kar treati of oct ar these includ the north atlant treati forc western interfer turkish intervent the moment turkei dare step into thi conflict it will close the door of ani chanc of turkei be part of europ as if it ever will and will destroi the eastern third of anatolia dr rasizad intern realpolitik is not as simpl mind as you would have us believ ar upper karabakh gener is describ in western press report as an ar armenian enclav within azerbaijan the truth is that the armenian ar began to appear there onli in the middl of the last centuri
