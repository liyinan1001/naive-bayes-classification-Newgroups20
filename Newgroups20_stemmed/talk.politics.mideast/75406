subject re isra murder in march in articl apr thunder mcrcim mcgill edu hasan mcrcim mcgill edu write stuff delet i wrote ar you call name or give me a titl if the first read your paragraph abov if not i accept the titl in order to let you get into the um well debat again hasan repli i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unless you consid yourself deserv less unless you ar refer to someon els you have in fact given me a name i did not ask for henc the term name call hasan write so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom i repli if you insist on give me name titl i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctli sigh hasan gloat that wa onli to confus you ha ha ha hei hell bent on retard into childhood no when you ar intention neglect the most import fact that the whole isra presenc in the occupi territori is illegitim and henc all their action their court their law ar illegitim on the ground of occupi territori no i am not neglect that i m mere ask you whether the exist of isra citicen in the wb or in gaza invalid those individu right ar you try to retali and confus me here no i realli do try to spell correctli and i apolog if i did confus you i will try not to repeat that to live a as you so eloqu put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be us in the territori later also you have not adress my question if the isra also have human right first my abov statement doesnot sai that the exist of isra citizen in the wb revok their right of life but it sai the isra occup of the wb revok the right of life for some most it citizen basic revok the right of for it militari men clearli occup is an undeclar war dure war attack against militari target ar fulli legitim ok let me re phrase the question i have repeatedli ask you if the isra have less human right than the palestinian and if so why from your post where you did not directli adress my question i infer that you thought so togeth with the abov statement i then assum that the reason wa the action of the state of israel re your statement of occup i d like you to defin the term so i don t have to repeat thi drag the answer out of hasan procedur more than neccesari secondli sure isra have human right but thei ask their gover to protect it by withdraw from the occupi terretori not by further oppress palestinean human right i m sorri but the abov sentenc doe not make sens pleas rephras it if a state can depriv all it s citizen of human right by it action then tell me why ani human live todai should have ani right at all becaus not all state ar like israel as oppress as ignor or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human right of the syrian iraqi and other doe the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurd in iraq and turkei how about the same in sweden ok mayb a bit farfetch the russian in the baltic state or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serb have ani human right remaina accord to you and which system do you propos we us to solv the me problem the question is not which system would solv the me problem why becaus ani system can solv it the law of minist sharon sai kick palestinean out of here all palestin i ask for which system should be us that will preserv human right for all peopl involv i assum that wa obviou but i won t repeat that mistak now that i have straighten that out i m eagerli await your repli so you agre that that an isra solut wouldnot preserv human right i am understand thi from your first statement in thi paragraph no i m agre that to just kick all the palestinian out of israel proper would probabl lead to disast for both parti if that s what you refer to as the isra solut then so be it joseph weitz administr respons for jewish colon said it best when write in hi diari in between ourselv it must be clear that there is no room for both peopl togeth in thi countri we shall not achiev our goal of be an independ peopl with the arab in thi small countri the onli solut is a palestin at least western palestin west of the jordan river without arab and there is no other wai than to transfer the arab from here to the neighbour countri to transfer all of them not on villag not on tribe should be left onli after thi transfer will the countri be abl to absorb the million of our own brethren there is no other wai out davar septemb courtesi of marc afifi just a question if we ar to disregard the rather obviou refer to get israel out of me on wai or the other in both plo coven and hama charter that s the english translat if you have other inform i d be interest to have you translat it why should we give ani credenc to a privat paper even older i m not go to get into the question if he wrote the abov but it s fairli obviou all parti in the conflict have their share of fanat guess what those ar not the peopl that will make ani last peac in the region more delet stuff exactli you ar right i guess that the problem is that the isra gover is full with men like joseph weitz oh have you met with them person to read their diari fascin what do you do for a live we and our either refer to zionist or jew i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist isra system for solv the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer sinc i ask for a system that could solv the problem you said ani could be us then you provid a contradict abov you wrote that you understood what i meant underlin by ani system can be us to solv the conflict but not ani system would resolv it justli an unjust solut would be a non solut per definit no you said the follow for all a it hold that a have properti b there exist an a such that properti b doe not hold thu either or both statement must be fals guess where that take your logic to never never land you ar prove yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradict in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i wa mere point out a not so small flaw in your reason sinc you claim to be logic i felt it best to point thi out befor you start us your statement to prove a point or so am i then to assum you ar not logic the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the wai let me add that these cute quot you put at the end ar a real bummer when i try give your post ani credit why do you feel asham by thing and fact that you believ in if you were a zionist if you believ in zionist code and act well i feel sorri for you becaus the same rabbi shoham had said ye zionism is racism if you feel asham and bother by the zionist code then drop zionism if you ar not zionist why ar you bother then you should join me in condemn these racist zionist code and act ani quot can be misus especi when us to stereotyp all individu by a statement of an individu if you us the same method that you credit zionist with then where doe that place you oh by the wai i d advic you not to assum anyth about my loyalti i will and am condemn act i find vile and inhuman but i ll try as long as i can not to assum those act ar by a whole peopl by zionist abov do you mean the state of israel the govern of israel the leader of israel polit and or religi or the jew in gener if you feel the need to condemn condemn those respons instead how would you feel if we start condemn you person base on the bomb in egypt jona flygar wherev you go there you ar v ktargatan f uppsala sweden
