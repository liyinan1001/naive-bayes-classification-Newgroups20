soderstrom stone him the flyer pick thing up offens after the kill wa over but didn t get anyth home shot were flyer the flyer were content with the goal lead in the third period and thei decid that if tommi want a shutout he wa go to have to work for it a littl the flyer got most of the score chanc in the first or so minut of the period but couldn t get past puppa then the leaf got tire of lindro make road kill out of them and temper flare each for doug gilmour and lindro unsportsmanlik conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill rough all at terri carkner then took a knee penalti at on gilmour again the flyer smother the leaf power plai at about the minut mark dave andreychuk got a shot awai from hi left circl that got through soderstrom the puck wa roll on it s side and as luck would have it it turn awai from the net instead of turn toward it think of how a roll quarter inevit start to lean on wai or the other second later rod brind amour trip up gilmour at to give the leaf anoth chanc on the power plai on the advantag after soderstrom stone andreychuk while ly down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and wa

recchi got the initi minor krushelnyski baumgartn and lindro each got rough minor at rous and beranek express their mutual dislik for each other and got each for slash to set up anoth on mike eastwood shove down ryan mcgill in the flyer zone as thei were battl for the puck and while mcgill wa down he ran hi stick across mcgill s face the flyer were not happi with that at all al conroi pair up with berehowski and start throw punch upward well al held hi own much to the delight of the crowd each got a coupl punch in befor go down in a head and al got a stand o penalti eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowski and conroi each fight at so a major penalti for the rest of the game for the flyer the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood gallei and brind amour plai catch until hawgood found dineen all alon in the left circl he control the puck and blast it past puppa at that wa all the firework tommi soderstrom would not face anoth shot puppa did but kept the flyer off the board flyer shot were flyer in the rd probabl the strongest game i ve seen from the flyer sinc the all star break shutout number for soderstrom all sinc ti for nd most in the nhl but he s plai fewer game than belfour or the goali i can t rememb that he s ti with next up it s the winnipeg selann tuesdai night in winnipeg the flyer cannot be elimin if thei win but a loss coupl with an island win that night in washington would be the offici end flyer up to point on the season in game last year thei had point in game under so thei need at least point in their last game to improv on that onli by percentag point under in is better than under in tragic number hold at point with game left the tragic number for th is point i watch the ranger blow a third period lead at home to lose befor i finish thi up why point instead of well the flyer will win the tie breaker if thei catch them wherea the island win tie breaker against the flyer and so need onli a tie the ranger could crumbl down the stretch as thei plai the devil the pen twice the flyer and finish up with game against the cap so i guess th place could be the goal for the team to focu on flyer team record watch eric lindro
