subject shark review part left wing appar part defensemen number through wa lost when i post it to make thing wors i lost my own copi i have ask on the shark mail list on which it did get out to see if someon can mail me a copi back if someon respond i will repost it when i get it otherwis i will re write it in a dai or two and post it sorri about that larri depalma season rd acquir free agent from minnesota grade i c d no netter fan watch the shark includ me know where depalma wa at the end of the season the shark appear to still have hi right but he wasn t in san jose he wasn t in kansa citi and hi name hasn t appear on the waiver wire and that kind of invis wa preval for the most part for depalma after be call up octob against the tampa bai lightn depalma had an excel week score point in game while plai good defens unfortun the year old depalma then disappear the rest of the wai get just more point in more game and gener look letharg and uninterest on both end of the ic he then wa sent down to kansa citi walk out from there and wa suspend and later reinstat when it wa reveal that he wa injur he then promptli disappear from the watch ey of shark byte as the mail list is now known to shark offici faith and neither the shark nor we miss him johan garpenlov season rd acquir trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and th round pick in entri draft from vancouv grade a a after an earli slump garpenlov wa noth short of inspir the rest of the wai finish with point in game second highest total on the team as he click well with team mvp kelli kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finish second in the mvp vote clearli demonstr hi playmak and score skill as he wa seen make excel center pass as well as finish pass to him by put the puck past oppos goaltend get a club high power plai goal contrari to hi previou rep garpenlov also show that despit hi small size lb he wa will to throw himself around when necessari albeit not veri success yet he also still need to work on hi defens although he improv tremend throughout the season and wa actual quit a good penalti killer by the end of the season he will be a major kei to the offens next year david bruce season th acquir from st loui in expans draft grade i after a banner when he led the team in power plai goal and wa third in total score point in game bruce wa bother virtual all of thi season with a groin injuri which kept him out of the lineup for all by game thi season of cours it is difficult to specul how well he would have done thi season had he not been affect by the injuri but the year old bruce wa effect with a man up or a man short in the shark first season and wa expect to be a strong offens leader thi season as well the injuri appear seriou which is a shame becaus otherwis he mai have a much brighter futur for now instead hi futur with the shark next season appear cloud mark pederson season rd acquir trade with philadelphia for c lw dave snuggerud grade i b it is difficult for me to understand the flyer decis to unload pederson after a veri good offens season last season point in game but after ride the pine earli in the season pederson wa summarili sent to the shark in exchang of the defens mind snuggerud and he finish with game combin with the flyer and the shark he wa also limit by injuri thi season and thi limit hi product point but when healthi pederson appear impress with a good score touch good size and the willing to throw it around although he s not consid a physic forward and good speed he also doe not appear to be a liabil on defens but the shark probabl have to wait until next season to see how much exactli pederson can do john carter season th acquir free agent from boston grade i b b carter wa definit on of the hardest worker on the team and the hard work work wonder as at time he look great on ic howev although he did look great at time the fact that he receiv just point in game for hi effort is a sign that there is onli so much hi hard work can do and the shark confirm that by send him to kansa citi with about game left in the season carter who will turn on mai alwai hussl but as a result wa sometim trap too deep within the offens zone while forecheck but he wa gener a credit on the defens end but he is probabl of limit util in that capac and he did not impress offens although he wa on of the best shark at draw penalti he is veri unlik to be back next season jean francoi quintin season st acquir from minnesota in dispers draft grade i b b i don t understand why the shark didn t let quintin plai ani more than the game he plai thi season he wa gener hard work and creat opportun offens and appear at ag readi for regular nhl duti at least for a team like the shark finish with point in those game while not be a defens liabil shoulder injuri in train camp befor the season limit quintin the team s lead scorer in exhibit game despit sit out the final two to just game with the shark and the blade that season but he look impress he should be a solid contend for regular duti next season mark beaufait season st acquir nd round pick in supplement draft grade i after a all star season at kansa citi beaufait got a cup of coffei with the shark late in the season when the blade knock down a playoff spot and the shark decim with injuri plai game and score a goal for hi onli nhl point thu far despit small size lb beaufait wa not shy to throw himself around when necessari and look pretti good at time although it s too earli to judg him base on nhl game in which he plai mostli left wing awai from hi center posit at northern michigan and kansa citi jaroslav otevrel season st acquir th round pick in entri draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also plai awai from hi normal posit when he wa up for hi cup of tea game midwai through the season he wa gener veri much of a defens liabil and did not show much offens either although that mai be more indic of the lack of ic time he got in those game he mai need anoth season to work on hi defens but onc hi defens is accept he should be readi michel picard season st acquir trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b c the year old picard although he perenni tore up the minor seem to be close to be out of chanc for some reason after be acquir by the shark but fail to impress the manag in game score goal for hi onli point and he spent most of the rest of the wai in kansa citi he wa not particularli strong defens and despit hi offens brillianc in the minor he ha fail thu far to score in the nhl although he ha been given limit opportun he mai be the shark bait in the expans draft dodi wood season st acquir rd round pick in entri draft grade i d d although perhap i shouldn t give a grade at all i have been accus of knock on wood too much then it is probabl no surpris to you that i am thoroughli unimpress by wood thu far although game is a small exampl he wa gener a nonfactor on offens wa not particularli good defens and took too mani silli penalti lose mani fight in the process and gather penalti minut in those game project to to in an game season he s not readi and need at least anoth season at kc where he can work on hi fight skill if noth els hi rel small size lb doe not give much possibl that he can surviv at thi stage as an enforc go calgari flame al macinni for norri gari
