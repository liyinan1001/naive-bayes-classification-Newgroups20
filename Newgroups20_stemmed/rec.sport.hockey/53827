subject re wing will win gballent hudson uvic ca greg ballentin write all of thi is fine i never said that murrai wa a bad gm i mere said that he isn t the best gm in hockei or even a contend for that honor if murrai is as great as you claim the wing would have won the stanlei cup by now probabl more than onc if he wa as great a gm as you claim i think you miss on of my point there it take more than a great gm to win a stanlei cup even onc some of the gui on the list you gave earlier never won on i agre that you and i could probabl argu back and forth for dai to no avail about who is the best gm in hockei that is a matter of opinion and who is to sai my opinion is ani better than your or your than mine but the point of my origin origin post if not well state wa that murrai ha the gm abil but not the coach abil which lead to below and he wa as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intellig enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success i think at thi point there s a person emot element involv here which transcend murrai s logic thought as outsid it s fine for us to sai he should hire a differ coach in fact he ha talk about do so in the past but the press here in detroit at least ha so built up thi busi about murrai never get past the second round of the playoff as a coach that i think he ha taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he is capabl of coach a team past the second round he need to as the paper sai get that monkei off hi back so it becom a matter not of intellig but of pride is it foolish to let pride stand in the wai of sound logic perhap but we re all a littl that wai from time to time i think eventu he ll step down from behind the bench and concentr on hi gm duti and the team will improv as a result i think hi coach duti take awai time he might have otherwis spent on gm work in that sens onc he step down as coach we ll see how good of a gm he realli is but murrai is an averag unspectacular nhl coach and a pretti good gm so none of thi is true anywai i mai not agre with everyth you ve said but it s been fun discuss it with you gregmeist randi
