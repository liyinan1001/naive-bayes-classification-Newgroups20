subject flyer note the flyer close out the season last night with their th straight victori a ot winner over the hartford whaler the ot game winner came from dimitri yushkevich just hi th of the season and hi first game winner the flyer never led up until that point in the game for the whaler the loss mark an nhl record th ot loss thi season roster move gord hyne wa call to to plai in place of ryan mcgill injuri ryan mcgill injur hi hand in a fight and wa scratch line eklund lindro recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroi faust acton brown gallei bowen yushkevich hawgood carkner hyne domin roussel game summari i didn t get tv coverag of the game and sinc it wa stormi in these part i didn t have the best radio coverag either here s the box score follow by a few thing i did pick up first period hartford nyland philadelphia recchi lindro brind amour pp penalti verbeek har hold carkner phi rough houda har interfer second period hartford burt cunneyworth kron philadelphia bowen eklund recchi hartford nyland zalapski sanderson penalti gallei phi major game misconduct spear verbeek har major game misconduct spear brown phi trip zalapski har trip brind amour

yushkevich faust penalti none power plai philadelphia of hartford of goali philadelphia roussel shot save hartford lenarduzzi on the first hartford goal gord hyne misplai the puck at the flyer blue line and nyland strip him and took off the recchi goal wa a on with lindro the bowen goal wa just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it end up behind the goali on the second nyland goal he got three whack at the puck befor it went in thi is the most frustrat part of the flyer defens take the bodi and if thei get on shot and beat you fine don t give them anoth chanc carkner gallei and mcgill ar all terribl about thi i ll bet monei at least on of them wa the closest flyer to the plai that s all i have my radio got bad after that and i wa lucki to know who it wa that score much less how from what i heard roussel had a veri strong game after the game gene hart ask bobbi taylor to pick the three star of the season rather than of the game it wa garri gallei for hi career high point total i m surpris that a former goali wouldn t look closer at hi defens plai tommi soderstrom for hi team record ty shutout in onli about a season and mark recchi for hi all time high team singl season score mark but here s the odd part he couldn t decid between lindro and recchi for number if he pick recchi as after he had a hard time choos between him and lindro doesn t that make lindro what you wanna know my three star of the season well sinc you ask eric lindro eric domin a game simpli by step out onto the ic the differ between the team s record with him and without him is no accid i believ that the team could have been almost as success without recchi there is no question that thi team is significantli better with eric lindro on it and i think that he will deservedli wear the c on hi jersei next season tommi soderstrom shutout wa second in the leagu to onli ed belfour and tommi didn t have a chri chelio booo in front of him he also didn t plai a complet season due to heart problem sentiment edg here my famili ha a histori of heart problem there s no question in my mind that tommi soderstrom is thi team goali of the futur and if roussel complain again about be number look for him to be trade within year mark recchi again you can t argu with an all time team high singl season score mark there ar an aw lot of team that didn t have a singl player get as mani point plu mark is the onli flyer to plai the entir season not a tough choic honor mention rod brind amour top hi singl season high point total which he set last year the differ wa that he wasn t on the top line thi year and didn t get as much plai time then again he didn t get the defens attent that he got last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich wa the team most consist defenseman ye he made rooki mistak but he wa usual fast enough to make up for them i have a feel that with hi shot he ll score a few more point next year without give up anyth in hi own zone and i suspect that he ll be the team top defenseman in year to come garri gallei wa the team s point leader from defensemen again there ar some thing you just can t argu with and he battl with chronic fatigu syndrom he certainli deserv kudo for onli miss on game and that wa against hi wish under doctor order but hi defens plai often negat hi offens contribut a littl more caution and a littl bit smarter in hi own end will make him a much more import part of the team next year brent fedyk wa the leagu biggest improv over last year point total but consist becam a problem for him a coupl misc note mostli for mail
