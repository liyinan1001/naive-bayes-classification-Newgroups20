subject re vlad s playoff pick in articl vzhivov cunew vzhivov alfr carleton ca vladimir zhivov write wale confer adam divis semifin boston vs buffalo the bruin ar plai some excel hockei and with cam neeli back and moog hi old self again thi should be a cake walk bruin in i m hope for a fuhr miracl but i agre that boston will like win the seri goaltend is about equal top offens player ar about equal mogilni lafontain vs oat juneau but buffalo ha no answer to neeli not to impli that neeli is not a top offens player btw in fact he s on of my favourit even though he s a damn bruin and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favour boston anywai but i think it will go six quebec vs montreal thi on is veri tough to call montreal certainli ha the experi factor but quebec is more talent imho it ll come down to the goali i ll go with experi and roi canadien in agre here but montreal will be push to the limit is it just me or doe everyth montreal doe in the playoff come down to roi go hab final boston vs montreal will bruin domin continu in thi rivalri ye moog ha consist outperform roi in the playoff after other stuff bruin in five i can t predict a montreal victori becaus i ve been watch them plai for week and imo thei severli need some tougher player especi to plai in the garden last time thei beat the b s but boston had a clear territori advantag the victori wa roi s at the same time i can t bring myself to predict the possibl of a loss so i ll just sai i will not be put monei on thi seri patrick divis semifin pittsburgh vs ny island what can i sai the pen ar fly high and have the most talent in the leagu agre ny doesn t have the goaltend to stop the onslaught independ of the troubl thei have given pittsburgh thi year pen in five which is credit to ny washington vs new jersei capit in agre here too but i think it will go at least six jersei ha a decent team and washington ha done poorli against the divis thi year pittsburgh vs washington if the cap had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupr just doesn t inspir my hope penguin in i think thei will us tabaracci more after beaupr get shell i don t think it will go six either mayb five confer final pittsburgh vs boston a replai of last year the penguin ar just as good as month ago and the bruin ar much improv but penguin in if pittsburgh plai boston imo thei win in like five possibl six thei own the bruin if thei plai montreal i think it will go to seven and onc again i won t be put monei on the seventh game i sai seven becaus the hab have plai pittsburgh veri tough thi season campbel confer norri divis semifin chicago vs st loui or minnesota blackhawk in chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good imo and rememb that thei take ridicul number of penalti detroit vs toronto the leaf have had an excel season but thei ve been plai playoff hockei all year the hab under burn were the same wai and alwai wilt in the playoff red wing in veri true the leaf have much to be proud of but thei will soon find out why montreal did so lousi in the playoff toronto might win two or three at mlg though wing in six mayb even seven final chicago vs detroit thi will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wing in it will be a war possibl the most intens playoff seri of them all and ye i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though smyth divis semi final vancouv vs winnipeg canuck in our first disagr canuck ar plai like shit thei don t us their size at all which mai explain why thei get hammer by a team chase them calgari winnipeg in six calgari vs lo angel thi would have been tough to call except for three thing the king don t have a goali gari robert will be back the king shot themselv in the foot by trade a proven winner paul coffei for a proven loser jimmi carson gretzki is just too weari to carri thi group flame in thi is also tough for me to call becaus i haven t seen the smyth enough i don t think robert will be well enough to figur in coffei is a non issu who care what carson ha done befor and never underestim gretzki la in six final vancouv vs calgari flame in if it is these two calgari will not need six game but i think it will be la winnipeg anywai and la in seven becaus of home ic cofer final detroit vs calgari red wing in wow must ve been tough to go against your team but let s see i pick la detroit detroit will win probabl in six stanlei cup final pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row and offici dynasti statu for the pen or can the wing complet a dream season well the wing ar better in goal not suffici so though imho and have better d men howev mario and the boi can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoff though i sure would love to see probert beat some sens into him the pen ar just too much especi sinc detroit will have a tougher battl to get here penguin in if pittsburgh plai detroit it will go longer than five and i wouldn t bet against the wing thei ar veri strong imo and nobodi know how strong becaus thei ve been underachiev most of the year if forc to choos though i d have to take the penguin a side note vlad last week you said that selann wa a better player than gilmour no wai he is a more talent pure goal scorer but asid from the ag differ there is no wai i would take him over gilmour on my team i m not ask for flame either btw i ve spent more than enough time argu on behalf of selann and i still sai he s a great player but while he and gilmour ar both danger offens give teemu an edg gilmour doe it all i know a lot of gilmour bash goe on esp from flame fan but imo you gui ar let your dislik of gilmour cloud your judgement when it come to hi skill he is easili on of the best all round player in the nhl dchhabra stpl ist ca
