subject standard colormap i m work on an x r applic and have concern regard standard colormap the x r document sai usual a window manag creat these colormap i wonder what window manag the writer had in mind neither twm or mwm seem to creat standard colormap of cours on can us xstdcmap to creat standard colormap howev xstdcmap doesn t seem to try veri hard to avoid conflict with the default colormap when i us standard colormap creat by xstdcmap the rest of my displai goe black so it seem as if us of standard colormap caus the veri problem standard colormap ar intend to avoid perhap if everi applic us standard colormap thing would be wonder but not mani applic seem to us standard colormap final the oper of the function xmugetcolormapalloc xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsist with the section of the x r xlib document accord to the section of the x r xlib document p for grayscal colormap onli the colormap red max red mult and base pixel member ar defin the other member ar ignor to comput a grayscal pixel valu us the follow express grai red mult base pixel xffffffff xmugetcolormapalloc defin in mit lib xmu cmapalloc c is us by xmulookupstandardcolormap defin in mit lib xmu lookupcmap c to select red max green max and blue max valu for the call to xmustandardcolormap when the rgb grai map properti is specifi xmugetcolormapalloc set red max to of the total number of cell in the grai scale set green max to of the total number and set blue max ot of the total number refer to section on would expect xmugetcolormapalloc to set red max to the total number of cell in the grai scale when the rgb grai map properti is specifi xmustandardcolormap defin in mit lib xmu stdcmap c set red mult green mult and blue mult all equal to refer to section on would expect green mult and blue mult to be ignor when red mult green mult and blue mult all equal xmucreatecolormap defin in mit lib xmu crcmap c construct a grai map the sum of red max green max and blue max give the maximum grai valu refer to section on would expect red max to give the maximum grai valu
