qtk rn picasso cssc syd tansu com au gpatapi boyd tansu com au write what sort of traffic is gener with the x call i am curiou to find out the requir bandwidth that a link must have if on machin run dv x is support multipl user client and we requir adequ respons time anyon have ani idea i expect the limit factor will be your server machin not the network itself to give you a real world exampl here at quarterdeck we have roughli peopl us dvx to talk to a bunch of unix box novel file server and each other it s not too much of a load on our ethernet with mayb concentr so you have peopl on each segment if you had a badli load net or the app you want to run were veri network intens you could run into some slowdown but the biggest problem would be the machin itself sai you have a with plenti of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have peopl run program off it you re go to see some slowdown becaus you re now on effect a mhz of cours dvx will attempt to see if task ar idl and make sure thei give up their time slice but if you have work program run you ll know it well i can bui a bigger and more power server machin becaus of the signific drop in price year after year the link i want to us though isdn k is costli and the bandwidth limit that s why my interest li in see if such a link can be us and see what traffic goe through it sinc i don t think tom alwai get time to read thi group i ll take the liberti of respond to some of thi if you realli want tom to repli you should send mail to support qdeck com a k line is certainli go to restrict you far more than the mbp ethernet that we typic run how restrict it will be depend on what you run and how you run it i would think that a coupl of instanc of some realli nasti program like smoke clover would make the link useless for anyon els on the other hand probabl xclock quietli updat everi second or so wouldn t impact it too much in the real world you will be somewher in between these two extrem go by the wai i person us x on a daili basi i wouldn t want to have to share that k link with more than other peopl have said that if you can tweak the program be run by ad in call to give up time slice when idl and that sort of thing you could probabl run peopl on a given machin befor you start see slowdown again thi time from network bandwidth hmmm ha anyon at your centr monitor the traffic at all ar you run ani standard ms window program like word what sort of packet go blaze through what size link do you have mb or mb what is the averag traffic flow go through your network or do you have few high peak and then mani low point our corpor wan is as uniqu as ani other the usag pattern ar not veri good predictor of how your will behav the onli on of our low bandwidth link that normal get us in thi wai is a k link to ireland that thei often us to run a do text base client end of a client server databas remot from the dvx machin behind me sinc the server end is or wa alwai at thi end california it is faster to remot run the client via desqview x and have a short hop to the server than run the client local and have a long hop to the server as i warn you thi tell us veri littl about how you usag pattern will fill a k isdn link run word for window remot is go to itself be veri usag depend let s break it into piec and look at it track the mous pointer is easi and effici to translat from window call into x pop up a menu is a littl more involv and will gener some traffic restor the screen that wa cover by that menu mai be easi and mai not be doe the server that it s displai on have back store if so and the server had enough memori the displai can be updat local and will gener littl network traffic if no back store then what wa be cover up if it wa a solid color rectangl of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quit easili if it wa a full color backdrop of ren stimpi we mai have to send it back to the x server bit by bit dvx will do it level best to onli redraw that small area but in some unusu case the entir screen mai need to be repaint assun a x screen with bit per pixel that s bit that ha to be sent worst possibl case you re look at about second in realiti it would never be thi bad sinc the screen will alwai have part that will be tranlat into higher level x call it all realli depend on what the program ar do ie you re go to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your app ar all do network thing also what do you mean by network thing i vision us ms window and other window applic over the network were the process ar run on the server and all i am get ar the displai i am wonder how good is the x and subsequ dv x protocol in transfer these imag with x call and displai them on a client s machin x wa design from the ground up to be effici across a network it s pretti good for thi x program ar best do text program ar almost as good sinc we conert them to x easili someth like winx is a hybrid we intercept the call window make to it s graphic driver mous driver keyboard driver and convert them to x the call window is make ar in no wai design to be effici on a packet switch network we go to a lot of troubl to convert them to the high level xlib call we can but we ar somewhat limit becaus we onli know what window and it applic tell us quarterdeck offic system gari rich problem resolut dept anonym ftp site qdeck com for
