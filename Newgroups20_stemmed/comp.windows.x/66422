problem is typic solv by us an interact applic builder tool or by us cut past on exist x applic good applic which you might look to manipul when you want to test just thi on littl thing includ contrib client xskel a simpl r program that put up a window and allow sketch in it and offer a start point for quick hack the xaw exampl in the exampl directori in the r and r distribut and the xlib hello world exampl in the r doc helloworld and r doc tutori helloworld an updat version of thi program which us r xlib call and current icccm convent wa post in to comp window x by glenn widen of tektronix in addit a sampl xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute show how to open multipl displai and how to catch a broken displai connect is avail on export lc mit edu in contrib mdisp tar z subject why doe xtgetvalu not work for me sic the xtgetvalu interfac for retriev resourc from a widget is sensit to the type of variabl your code mai be do someth like thi arg arg int i int sensit oop wrong data type i xtsetarg arg i xtnsensit sensit i xtgetvalu widget arg i but xtnsensit is a boolean which on most machin is a singl byte declar the variabl sensit as boolean work properli thi problem come up often when us particular toolkit that redefin the xt type dimens and posit code that assum thei ar int will have similar problem if those type ar actual short in gener you ar safe if you us the actual type of the resourc as it appear in the widget s man page subject why don t xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work you re probabl try to us these function from applic code thei should be us onli intern to widget these function ar for a parent widget to chang the geometri of it children other promis function xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest ar also for us onli by widget in thi case by a child to request a chang from it parent the onli wai for your applic to request a geometri chang for a widget is to issu an xtsetvalu call set some of the geometri resourc although thi will result in the widget intern function be call your applic code must us the standard xtsetvalu interfac or risk the widget data becom corrupt the xlib call xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarli be avoid thei shouldn t be us to chang xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight subject why isn t there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow although there ar variou detail of the current implement of the xt intern which make repar difficult the major reason that no such call exist is that it remain undefin what the set of resourc for the new widget should be resourc ar typic set base on the locat in the instanc hierarchi what resourc should chang if the instanc move what should happen to the widget s children and by the time such semant ar defin there would probabl be littl advantag over destroi the old widget and creat a new widget in the correct locat with the desir resourc as set the resourc correctli is the major of work in creat a new widget note that repar is
