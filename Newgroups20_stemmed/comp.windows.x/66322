x intrins it is on export in contrib faq xt why doe my applic core dump when i us signal alarm cthread in brief xlib xt and most widget set have no mutual exclus for critic section ani interrupt handler is like to leav on of the abov librari in an inconsist state such as all the appropri flag not yet set dangl pointer in the middl of a list travers etc note that the ansi c standard point out that behavior of a signal handler is undefin if the signal handler call ani function other than signal itself so thi is not a problem specif to xlib and xt the posix specif mention other function which mai be call safe but it mai not be assum that these function ar call by xlib or xt function the onli safe wai to deal with signal is to set a flag in the interrupt handler thi flag later need to be check either by a work procedur or a timeout callback it is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler as anoth note it is danger to add a work procedur that never finish thi effect preempt ani work procedur previous ad and so thei will never be call anoth option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end us xtappaddinput and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal howev thi could deadlock your process if the pipe fill up why don t the intrins deal with thi problem primarili becaus it is suppos to be a portabl layer to ani hardwar and oper system is that a good enough reason i don t think so note the articl in the x journal and the exampl in o reilli volum ar in error how do i us a differ visual than the default thi requir a more complic answer than it should a window ha three thing that ar visual specif the visual colormap and border pixmap all widget have their own colormap and borderpixmap resourc onli shell widget have visual resourc anoth question deal with why shell have a visual the default valu of these resourc is copyfrompar which doe exactli what it sai in the shell widget copyfrompar get evalul as defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen when ani on of the three resourc is not properli set a badmatch error occur when the window is creat thei ar not properli set becaus each of the valu depend on the visual be us how to get thi to work there ar two part to the answer the first is if you want an applic to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an applic to start with a differ visual the second is actual easier becaus the basic inform you need is avail the first is a littl harder becaus you ll need to initi much of the toolkit yourself in order to determin the need inform some sampl code to start up an applic us someth other than the default visual to compil cc g visual c o visual lxaw lxmu lxt lxext lx lm to

appropri visual it ha to be specifi by the user if you disagre with thi then your applic probabl fall into the categori of alwai us the default visual or it is hardwar specif and expect some particular visual such as bit truecolor with an overlayplan extens or some such why no applic run in isol depend on the wai a server alloc resourc i mai not alwai want your applic to run in truecolor mode if it is go to mess up my other applic i mai be veri upset if it choos to run in greyscal instead of psuedocolor or just monochrom as an exampl on a low end color sun server there ar mani differ possibl visual monochrom entri colormap static grai static color and a truecolor the sgi iri s offer all the abov plu bit truecolor bit truecolor an overlai plane why do onli shell widget have a visual thi is strictli by convent it make it possibl for an arbitrari widget to know that the visual it us can be found by look for the shell widget that is it ancestor and obtain the visual of that shell a widget can have it own visual resourc if it doe it must have it own realiz method to us the visual when it call xcreatewindow you should also make thi a resourc that can be obtain with xtgetvalu so other widget can find it a reason valu is probabl xtnvisual which visual depth and colormap do shell inherit the default valu for these resourc ar set to copyfrompar thi is interpret as the defaultcolormapofscreen defaultdepthofscreen and the default visual of the screen if the widget ha no parent i e it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree if the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copi colormap and depth from it parent and us copyfrompar as the visual i ve done all the abov and i still get a badmatch error why some resourc convert improperli cach refer thi wa especi true of x r and earlier version of motif why doesn t my widget get destroi when i call xtdestroywidget see section of the xt specif it eventu doe get destroi just not immedi the intrins destroi a widget in a two phase process first it and all of it children have a flag set that indic it is be destroi it is then put on a list of widget to be destroi thi wai ani pend x event or further refer to that widget can be clean up befor the memori is actual freed the second phase is then perform after all callback event handler and action have complet befor check for the next x event at thi point the list is travers and each widget s memori is actual free d among other thing as some further caveat trivia the widget mai be destroi if the intrins determin that thei have no further refer to the widget on the list if so then the phase destruct occur immedi also if nest event loop ar us widget place on the destroi list befor enter the inner event loop ar not destroi until return to the outer event loop how do i exit but still execut the destroycallback the problem is if a simpl and entir reason approach to exit an applic is us such as call exit directli then a widget mai not have a chanc to clean up ani extern state such as open socket temporari file alloc x resourc etc thi code for simplic reason assum onli a singl toplevel widget widget toplevelget

immedi after destroi the toplevel widget the troubl is the phase destruct mai never occur thi work for most widget and most applic but will not work for those widget that have ani extern state you might think that sinc it work now it will alwai work but rememb that part of the reason an object orient approach is us is so on can be ignor of the implement detail for each widget which mean that the widget mai chang and somedai requir that some extern state is clean up by the destroi callback on altern is to modifi exitcallback to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a privat event loop howev privat event loop ar frown upon becaus it tend to encourag sloppi and difficult to maintain practic try the follow code instead includ x intrins h extern widget toplevelget if

to resiz the current manag child of the shell widget us xtsetvalu the geometri chang is then propag to the shell which ask the window manag which mai or mai not allow the request howev the shell must have the resourc xtnallowshellres set to true otherwis it will not even ask the window manag to grant the request and the shell will not resiz to chang the posit of a shell us xtsetvalu on the shell not the child and within the limit of the window manag it should be grant why can t xtappaddinput handl file it doe howev unix semant for when i o is readi for a file doe not fit most peopl intuit model in unix term a file descriptor is readi for read whenev the read call would not block ignor the set of option flag that indic not to block thi work as expect for termin socket and pipe for a file the read will alwai return but the return indic an eof i e no more data the result is the code in the intrins alwai call the input handler becaus it alwai think someth is about to be read the culprit is the select system call or on sysv base os s it is the poll system call how to get around thi on a unix system the best approach is to us anoth process to check for avail input on the file us a pipe to connect the applic with thi other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput a suitabl program on bsd system is tail f filenam it s rumor that select on some system is not complet reliabl in particular ibm aix thi is on where it would work for a while sever thousand time and then stop until some other event woke it up thi seem to be the result of a race condit in the kernel ibm claim to have a fix for thi pyramid doesn t work at all ultrix and possibl other where pipe ar implement as socket wasn t complet broken but although the write side wrote in byte block the read side receiv it all broken up as if it wa be put into the pipe a byte at a time you can wast a lot of time by read small block get raound it by detect the situat and have select ignor the pipe for msecond by then it had been given the whole block note that all the abov descript us unix terminolog such as read file descriptor pipe etc thi is an os depend area and mai not be ident on all system howev the intrins design felt it wa a common enough oper that it should be includ with part of the toolkit why thei didn t also deal with signal at thi point i don t know what good

of resourc convert string to data type data type to string data type to data type i string to data type usual a string to data type convert ha a fix set of string that will be convert to data type valu thi is most often us to map enumer name to enumer valu name valu true fals in thi case the string to data type convert need to compar the resourc valu to the list of fix string thi is most readili accomplish by the us of the quark mechan of the resourc manag the resourc valu is turn into a quark which is a uniqu represent of the string that fit into a singl word then the resourc quark is compar against the quark for the fix string repres the enumer valu if there ar mani enumer string in the convert or mani convert each with a small number of enumer string then a global initi routin might be us to turn all the resourc string into quark that wai the first time on of these convert is us the string will be turn into quark and held in static variabl for us in the next invoc of on of the convert ii data type to string thi type of convert is slightli easier than the string to data type convert sinc the us of quark isn t necessari instead the data type valu is simpli convert to a string valu probabl by the us of sprintf data type to string convert ar us for applic that wish to convert an intern data type valu into a string so that thei can write out a valid resourc specif to a file thi mechan can be us to provid a snapshot of applic state into a file thi snapshot can be us to restor the program to a known state via the usual x resourc databas mechan if you ar take the troubl to write a string to data type convert it isn t much extra effort to write the data type to string convert write both at the same time help to ensur that thei ar consist iii data type to data type thi type of convert is us to convert an exist data type valu to anoth data type for instanc an x pixel valu can be convert to an rgb data type that contain separ field for red green and blue the type signatur for a resourc convert is as follow typedef boolean xttypeconvert displai xrmvalueptr cardin xrmvalueptr xrmvalueptr xtpointer displai dpy xrmvalueptr arg cardin num arg xrmvalueptr fromval xrmvalueptr toval xtpointer convert data when the convert is invok the fromval argument point to the sourc x resourc manag valu and the toval argument point to the destin x resourc manag valu the convert data argument is an opaqu pointer to some convert specif data that is specifi when the convert is regist the arg and num arg argument allow extra inform to be pass to the convert when it is invok for instanc the pixel to rgb structur convert discuss abov would need colormap and visual argument in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb valu correspond to that pixel care must be taken with the toval argument an xrmvalu ha the follow type definit and specifi a size and locat for a convert valu typedef struct unsign int size caddr t addr xrmvalu xrmvalueptr when the convert is invok the address mai point to a locat of the given size for the convert valu or the locat can be null in the former case the convert should ensur that the size of the destin area is larg enough to handl the convert valu if the destin area is not larg enough then the convert should set the size to the amount of space need and return fals the caller can then ensur that enough space is alloc and reinvok the convert if the size is larg enough then the convert can simpli copi the convert valu into the space given and return true if the locat is null then the convert can assign the locat to the address of a static variabl contain the convert valu and return true when write a group of convert thi code is often repeat and it becom conveni to defin a macro defin done var type if toval addr if

the x resourc issu summer by oliv jone for a complet coverag of the issu involv most of thi answer is base on that articl in a nutshel on us xtopendisplai to add each displai to a singl applic context and then xtclosedisplai to shutdown each displai and remov it from the applic context the real problem occur when try to close down a displai thi can happen wai user select a quit button on on of the displai user ha window manag send a wm delet window messag server disconnect possibl from a killclient messag server shutdown crash or network failur i ll assum you can deal gracefulli with sinc it is mere a problem of translat a widget to a displai and remov that displai if not then read the oliv jone articl the third on is difficult to handl the follow is base on the oliv jone articl and i includ it here becaus it is a difficult problem the difficulti aris becaus the xlib design presum that an i o error is alwai unrecover and so fatal thi is essenti true for a singl displai x base applic but not true for a multipl displai program or an applic that doe thing other than displai inform on an x server when an x i o error occur the i o error handler is call and if it return then an exit happen the onli wai around thi is to us setjmp longjmp to avoid return to the i o error handler the follow code fragment demonstr thi includ setjmp h jmp buf xiorecov void xiohandl dpy displai dpy destroydisplai dpy longjmp xiorecov main if setjmp xiorecov xsetioerrorhandl xiohandl xtappmainloop app context the destroydisplai is someth that given a displai pointer can go back to the applic specif data and perform ani necessari cleanup it should also call xtclosedisplai for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp longjmp when setjmp is first call it return a and save s enough inform in the jmp buf that a latter execut of longjmp can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp wa just execut the return valu of thi second setjmp is the valu of the second argument to longjmp there ar sever caveat about us these but for thi purpos it is adequ some other problem you might run into ar resourc convert that improperli cach resourc the most like symptom ar xlib error such as badcolor badatom or badfont there mai be problem with the total number of displai you can open sinc typic onli a limit number of file descriptor ar avail with be a typic valu you mai also run into

xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environ variabl control where xt look for applic default file as an applic is initi xt load at most on app default file from the path defin in xfilesearchpath and anoth from the path defin in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if softwar is instal on your system in such a wai that app default file appear in sever differ directori hierarchi suppos for exampl that you ar run sun s open window and you also have some r x applic instal in usr lib x app default you could set a valu like thi for xfilesearchpath and it would caus xt to look up app default file in both usr lib x and usr openwin lib or wherev your openwinhom is locat setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x t n openwinhom lib t n the valu of thi environ variabl is a colon separ list of pathnam the pathnam contain replac charact as follow see xtresolvepathnam n the valu of the filenam paramet or the applic s class name t the valu of the file type in thi case the liter

lookup usr lib x t n mean usr lib x app default myterm openwinhom lib t n mean usr openwin lib app default myterm as the applic initi xt tri to open both of the abov app default file in the order shown as soon as it find on it read it and us it and stop look for other the effect of thi path is to search first in usr lib x then in usr openwin let s consid anoth exampl thi time let s set xuserfilesearchpath so it look for the file myterm ad in the current work directori then for myterm in the directori app default setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app default n the first path in the list expand to myterm ad the second expand to home app default myterm thi is a conveni set for debug becaus it follow the imak convent of name the app default file myterm ad in the applic s sourc directori so you can run the applic from the directori in which you ar work and still have the resourc load properli note when look for app default file with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarr reason neither the type nor file suffix is defin so t and s ar useless with r there s anoth twist you mai specifi a custom resourc valu for exampl you might run the myterm applic like thi myterm xrm custom color if on of your pathnam specif had the valu usr lib x app default n c then the expand pathnam would be usr lib x app default myterm color becaus the c substitut charact take on the valu of the

xapplresdir or the user s home directori if xapplresdir is not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some valu other than the default xt ignor xapplresdir altogeth notic that the quick and dirti wai of make your applic find your app default file in your current work directori is to set xapplresdir to a singl dot in r all thi machineri work differ for r compatibilti mani peopl set their xapplresdir valu to a dot follow by a slash what order ar callback execut in courtesi of donna convers convers expo lc mit edu the intrins librari do not guarante an order thi is becaus both the widget writer and the applic writer have the abil to modifi the entir content of the callback list neither on current know what the other is do and so the intrins cannot guarante the order of execut the applic programm cannot reli on the widget writer the widget writer is not requir to document when the widget will add and remov callback from the list or what effect thi will have therefor the function contain in a callback should be independ of the function contain in other callback on the list even though the xt standard in the definit of xtaddcallback sai callback name specifi the callback list to which the procedur is to be append you mai not infer from the word append that the callback routin ar call in the same order as thei have been ad to the callback list how do i know if a widget is visibl courtesi of donna convers convers expo lc mit edu i am build a widget need to know if it is visibl i set the visibl interest field in core and if my window is complet obscur the core visibl flag goe fals howev if my window is iconifi the flag stai set to true right everyth is implement correctli thi demonstr a defici in the x protocol and the core widget is reflect the capabl of the protocol the defici is that the inform is avail in on wai in thi case an inconveni wai the xt specif is accur in the second and third paragraph of section so read thi section carefulli the visibl field will not chang in respons to iconif a visibilitynotifi event will not be receiv when the window goe from viewabl to unview that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmap that is when iconif occur thi is the protocol defici visibl state and viewabl state have specif mean in the x protocol see the glossari in your xlib and x protocol refer manual is thi a problem with mwm or is there someth els which need to be done you ll see thi with ani window manag with no window manag if the problem is mwm what is the fastest wai to determin if a window is iconifi as an applic writer keep track with a global boolean in an action routin with translat for mapnotifi and unmapnotifi on the shell widget which contain your custom widget as the custom widget writer see the map state field return by a call to xgetwindowattribut these ar suggest how do i repar a widget in xt i e xtreparentwidget you can t why us xtmalloc xtfree etc unfortun most code that call malloc realloc or calloc tend to ignor the possibl of return null at best it is handl someth like ptr type malloc sizeof type if ptr perror malloc in xyzzi exit to handl thi common case the intrins defin the function xtmalloc xtcalloc xtnew xtnewstr and xtrealloc which all us the standard c languag function malloc calloc and realloc but execut xterrormsg if a null valu is return xt error handler ar not suppos to return so thi effect exit in addit if xtrealloc is call with a null pointer it us xtmalloc to get the initi space thi allow code like if ptr ptr type malloc sizeof type els ptr type realloc ptr sizeof type count count to be written as ptr xtrealloc ptr sizeof ptr count also xtfree accept a null pointer as an argument gener i ve found the xt function conveni to us howev anytim i m alloc anyth potenti larg i us the standard function so i can fulli recov from not enough memori error xtnew and xtnewstr ar conveni macro for alloc a structur or copi a string struct abc xyzzi char ptr char str abcdef xyzzi xtnew struct abc take care of type cast ptr xtnewstr str a strict interpret of the intrins refer manual allow an implement to provid function that ar not exchang with malloc and free i e code such as char ptr ptr xtmalloc free ptr mai not work person i d call ani implement that did thi broken and complain to the vendor a common error for motif programm is to us xtfree on a string when thei should realli be us xmstringfre how to debug an xt applic first i d recomend get purifi from pure softwar thi is a great packag for trace memori problem on sun s it s a bit pricei at but i d

ani sort of xlib error you ll need to run in synchron mode easili accomplish with the sync command line argument or by set the variabl xdebug to with your debugg then set a break point in exit thi will let you trace back to the origin xlib function be call if you don t run in synchron mode then the actual error mai have occur ani number of call to xlib previous sinc the xlib call ar buffer and repli from the server ar asynchron next if you ar have troubl with window layout you can us the undocu resourc xtidentifywindow or the class resourc xtdebug to caus the widget name to be identifi with each window for exampl exampl xload xrm xtdebug true exampl xwininfo tree click in new xload window will give the normal inform but the widget name and class of each window is includ thi can help for check the locat and size of errant widget next if you ar have troubl with geometri manag or you want to test the wai a widget manag it s children you can try export lc mit edu contrib libxtgeo tar z thi act as a filter between ani children and a geometri manag and check the behaviour of both it s a veri clever idea the most unfortun problem is debug a callback while the applic is execut a grab of the keyboard or mous such as from a pulldown menu the server effect lock up and you ll need to go to anoth machin and kill the debugg manual the server lock up becaus the applic be debug ha said no on els can have access to the keyboard but the applic is not stop wait becaus the debugg is wait for your command unfortun you can t give them becaus all the input is go to your applic which is stop the best wai to debug thi kind of problem is with two machin on your desk run the program under a debugg or other environ on on machin and run the applic on the other possibl us a command sequenc like thi othermachin xhost thismachin thismachin setenv displai othermachin thismachin gdb applic your favorit debugg or thi othermachin xhost thismachin thismachin gdb applic gdb set environ displai othermachin gdb run i believ codecent a c interpret graphic debugg ha a method of deal with thi by explicit call the xlib function to releas ani grab dure breakpoint debug widget problem requir pretti good debug skill and knowledg of how widget work you can go a long wai without know the intern of a particular widget but not veri far without understand how a widget work judici us of condit breakpoint and ad print statement with the debugg help a great deal why don t xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc work i have got a delic problem with the three routin xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc the problem i have is that when i us them in my applic thei seem not to be registr properli i have made a handi littl testprogram where everyth work perfect but in my real applic noth happen the introduct in r of the xtapp function obsolet those routin see q for other chang in r r and r what happen is thei us a default applic context differ then the on you mai have creat sinc

fallback arg cnt xtaddtimeout xtaddworkproc xtappmainloop app would never invok the timeout what is and how can i implement drag and drop courtesi of roger reynold rogerr netcom com feb drag n drop is a buzzword for move data between client in an intuit fashion motif version support drag n drop capabl openlook ha support d n d all along the two protocol ar not compat with each other and so far as i know thei ar not publish i wrote a packag call rdd which is design to be a flexibl public protocol for do drag n drop oper between client my intent wa to provid a tool which would make it easi for peopl to support a standard drag n drop protocol in the program thei develop and contribut or sell regardless of what widget set is us as long as it is base on xt the implement is base upon my understand of the icccm convent for more detail read the code i have heard from dozen of peopl us rdd who like it and feel that it work a whole lot better than motif stuff also there seem to be mani
