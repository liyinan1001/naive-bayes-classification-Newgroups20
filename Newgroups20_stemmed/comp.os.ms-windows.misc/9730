subject mathcad swap file repost and summar for your inform or addit comment thi is long i have mb of memori on my sx mhz an intel math coprocessor and a mb hard drive with mb free no compress i have been run mathcad under window in enhanc mode with a mb ram drive mb mb smart drive and no swap file perman or temporari for sever month i am interest in the faster mathcad but i am concern about report swap file requir and the legitimaci of mathsoft s claim about increas speed to sx user will mathcad run without a swap file or insist that i us a swap file so far in respons to a less detail descript of my setup or in unrel post the more inform answer on the net or by e mail appear to be by fuess llnl gov david a fuess accord to mathsoft no mathcad us the swap file extens so as not to overburden the physic resourc thei sai thi is actual a win s featur a figur of mb wa indic to me as a minimum but you might try anywai by bert tyler satalink com bert tyler i m not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here i have a dx with mb of main memori less mb for a ramdisk and a bit for a do session that is open as part of the startup process which i have been run without ani swapfil when i instal the win s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win s subsystem itself demand the presenc of a swapfil the onli win s program i ve run to date is the bit version of freecel that came with that subsystem i gave window a small temporari swapfil i m leeri of file that must remain in fix locat on my hard disk and all seem well by bca ec cmu edu brian c anderson what is win i upgrad to mathcad and it instal a directori for win under window system dure the upgrad it told me that win wa requir by case student tc umn edu steven v case mathcad make us of the win s librari you ve probabl heard about win s it is a bit window librari that provid much of the window nt function no support for thread and multitask and such but can be run under window by rhynetc zardoz chem appstat edu thoma c rhyne i also have mb of ram and inde mathcad insist on a perman swapfil it would not run otherwis by bishop baeyer chem fsu edu greg bishop mathcad absolut requir mb ram with mb swap file or mb ram with mb swap file it will give you a not enough memori error if the swap file is less than mb it is a major resourc hog if you do not load the symbol processor or the smart math it take about mb of ram real or virtual just to load again due to the win s librari so it seem that in addit to the system requir shown on mathsoft s advertis for that you need a swap file possibl as big as mb look like i would just need an mb swap file and would need to choos or can i between a faster perman swap file or a slower temporari swap file appar a win subsystem ship with mathcad how much disk space doe thi requir i also receiv these answer by mfdjh uxa ecn bgu edu dale hampl if you ve got meg of ram why not configur meg as a ram disk for mathcad do permit differ bootup configur can mathcad win be configur to us such a ram drive instead of a swap file if not i don t see how us do for an altern bootup would provid window with thi swap file some time back i rememb a discuss about the issu of us a ram drive to support a swap file but i thought thi involv slower mb system i have do but for variou reason have not yet done a full instal by the wai is a full instal of do requir to avail oneself of the altern bootup featur which file from the instal disk ar requir by wild access digex com wildstrom presum you mean without a perman swap file if window need a swap file it will upo and creat on if a perman on doesn t exist perman is gener faster though i don t know why mathcad wouldn t be happi with either type ver is and so should ani program conform to the win specif so far mb ha been enough ram to avoid the overhead of run ani swap file i have been run mathcad under window without on
