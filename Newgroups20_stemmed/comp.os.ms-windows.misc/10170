subject re what doe the bmp format mean in articl robertsa unix tcd ie robertsa unix tcd ie andrew l robert write what exactli doe the window bitmap format look like i mean how is the data store width height no of colour bitmap data i couldn t find anyth in th user manual is there ani other refer materi which would give me thi inform from thoma sunshin kodak com thoma kinsman newsgroup comp os ms

copyright march abstract the format of imag creat for us by ms window applic is document in the ms window programm s refer guid thi guid is intend as a clearifi some word of the specif and to put forth a recommend among the variou altern pleas send updat correct suggest and revis to me pleas thank me for write thi on my own time by keep my name with the document thank you for your respect thi document copyright by thoma b kinsman if desir a postscript version of thi document is avail thi inform is free you get more than what you pai for don t sue me if i m wrong overview the dib imag file format is intend to be a devic independ bitmap file format what microsoft mean by devic independ is unclear to me four pixel resolut ar support bit bit bit and bit pixel these imag were intend for us on do ibm or littl endian system if you ar creat them on anoth architectur you will have to byte swap all short and long integ valu by convent dib imag end in the extens bmp thi is becaus march thei ar a super set of earlier bitmap imag file consequ you will sometim hear dib file refer to as bmp file sinc dib imag file ar a super set there ar three flavor of dib imag o do dib imag these ar the recommend convent and the form which i will describ how to creat thei ar intend for applic run under ms window in a do environ o os dib imag my understand is that these ar the flavor of dib imag that were us by the present manag o old style bitmap imag march differ between flavor the do dib imag consist of a bitmapfilehead file header which identifi the file as a dib file thi header also give the total size of the imag file and the offset to the imag data a bitmapinfohead imag header which specifi the imag attribut an option palett of color us by the imag if it exist thi mai contain or entri each entri is a window rgbquad structur the imag data itself the os dib imag consist of the same bitmapfilehead file header which identifi the file as a dib file thi header also give the total size of the imag file and the offset to the imag data a bitmapcorehead imag header which specifi the imag attribut an option palett of color us by the imag again if thi exist it mai contain or entri each entri is a window rgbtripl structur the imag data itself the old style imag bitmap consist of either a bitmapinfohead or a bitmapcorehead which header type is determin by the first long integ dword valu an option color palett thi palett mai be compos of either window rgbquad structur if the header wa a bitmapinfohead or window rgbtripl structur if the header wa a bitmapcorehead the imag data itself creat dib imag file creat a do dib imag file consist of sever straight forward step the header need to be creat and then written to the file these header structur ar defin in the ms window window h includ file palett inform need to be store for imag that ar not bit imag the five gener step ar fill in the bitmapfilehead and the bitmapinfohead structur the basic imag inform if the imag is a bit bit or an bit imag creat the color palett of rgbquad calcul the total file size and put thi inform in march the bfsize field of the bitmapfilehead calcul the offset to the imag data from the start of the file and put thi in the bfoffbit field of the bitmapfilehead write to the file the bitmapfilehead the bitmapinfohead the color palett and the imag data in that order the follow section describ structur in term of microsoft c type defin keyword the follow tabl describ these keyword for those not familiar with microsoft c type defin keyword in microsoft c typedef mean byte unsign charact word two byte unsign integ dword four byte unsign integ march the bitmapfilehead thi structur is defin in window h as typedef struct tagbitmapfilehead word bftype dword bfsize word bfreserv word bfreserv dword bfoffbit bitmapfilehead the bftype field is the two ascii charact b and m thi serv to identifi the file as a dib imag file on an intel byte order machin ibm or a compat thi constant can be form in c as the quantiti m b x d on an intel system the bfsize field is the total size of the file for our purpos thi field is equal to the size of the bitmapfilehead plu the size of the bitmapinfohead plu the number of entri in the color palett time the size of a rgbquad plu the number of byte of imag data if the imag data is be written out in an uncompress form thi valu can be calcul ahead of time otherwis thi field need to be fill in later both the bfreserv and the bfreserv field ar alwai set to zero the bfoffbit field is set to the offset to the start of the imag data from the start of the file for our purpos thi field should be set to the size of the bitmapfilehead plu the size of the bitmapinfohead plu the number of entri in the color palett time the size of a rgbquad thi work out becaus the imag data is written write after the color palett if on exist march the bitmapinfohead thi structur is defin in window h as typedef struct tagbitmapinfohead dword bisiz dword biwidth dword biheight word biplan word bibitcount dword bicompress dword bisizeimag dword bixpelspermet dword biypelspermet dword biclrus dword biclrimport bitmapinfohead the bisiz field is set to the size of the bitmapinfohead structur itself when read the imag file thi valu is what is us to determin that the imag contain a bitmapinfohead and not a bitmapcorehead the biwidth field is the width of the imag in imag pixel the biheight field is the height of the imag in imag line the biplan field should alwai be set to thi data is written out as if there wa on color plane the bibitcount field is the bit depth of the imag thi must be either or depend on the bit depth of the imag data the bicompress field tell how the imag data is compress if it is compress dib imag support two form of run length encod howev i have never seen ani imag which us it and don t know yet how it work set thi field to zero long zero or l to indic that the data is not compress all subsequ field of the bitmapinfohead structur mai be set to zero a requir of the interpret softwar that it be abl to comput these field as necessari from the previou inform the field which you might want to explicitli specifi might be biclrus for bit and bit imag thi field indic that not all of the possibl color entri ar us and that the imag contain biclrus color if you ar us onli color with an bit imag then you mai onli want to save of the possibl palett entri gener set thi field to zero march color palett each entri of a color palett is a rgbquad structur the rgbquad structur is defin in the window h includ file as typedef struct tagrgbquad byte rgbblue byte rgbgreen byte rgbred byte rgbreserv rgbquad the rgbreserv field is alwai zero for each color us the amount of blue green and red ar fill into the structur and the structur is written to the file a valu of zero in the rgbblue rgbgreen or rgbred field indic that that particular compon doe not contribut to the color composit a valu of in ani of these field indic that the compon contribut fulli to the color composit imag data there ar three surpris about the order of imag data in dib imag file the creator of thi format wa determin to be creativ and certainli wa within the imag data each line written out is pad to the next four byte quantiti so if you had an bit imag which wa onli on pixel wide you still have to write out four byte for everi imag line the number of byte per line can be calcul as byte per line width in pix bit depth or in term of the field of the bitmapinfohead structur byte per line biwidth bibitcount when write out your imag data you must write it out bottom line first the bottom line of the imag as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of imag data in the file for bit bit and bit imag inform is written as you would expect on bit imag ar pad eight pixel to a byte four bit imag ar pad two pixel to a byte eight bit imag ar written on pixel per byte twenti four bit imag ar written three byte per pixel howev for bit imag the inform must be written out in the order blue green red while most imag file format write data out in march an rgb order a dib imag file write the data out in an bgr order summari thi should provid enough inform to creat dib imag from applic such as scanner or for imag export routin if you find out ani more about dib imag pleas pass the inform on to me so that i
