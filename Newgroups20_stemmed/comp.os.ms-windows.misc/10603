have revis cosi pak to take advantag of the more robust signal process function avail in mathematica v sinc mathematica provid a better and work laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function than mathematica v did we adopt them thi ha made cosi pak smaller thu brian evan signal process packag that support the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function in the cosi pak v ar no
