subject re procomm plu for window problem kentil matt ksu ksu edu kent p iler write i have normal procomm plu for do but i ve been consid bui the window version it got realli great review in comput shopper i have a friend who connect to the mainfram and unix machin here us it but the screen seem to have a problem keep up with the modem he ha a modem on a mhz machin i can t see it have troubl keep up hi pcplu for do work great re what to do after the high speed modem arriv edit apr thi articl appli onli to window and and not to nt os or do app not run under window on of the unadvertis limit of most current window pc is that their rs c serial com perform is serious defici almost everyon who purchas a high speed modem v bi v pep or hst discov the problem the first time thei try to download a file or accept an incom fax at after upgrad the modem overrun and retri error abound even when the onli activ applic is the datacomm or fax program if the transfer complet at all it mai take even longer than with the old bp modem there ar three reason for the problem the univers asynchron receiv transmitt uart us in most pc ar primit ns devic with singl byte fifo buffer if the oper system driver cannot read and flush each charact at high interrupt rate the next incom charact overwrit the fifo and the previou on is lost do be a fairli singl mind environ dure datacomm can usual keep up window can t window ha more oper system overhead than plain do and interrupt often take longer to servic overrun ar much more like than under do as soon as you report to your pc modem vendor that you ar lose data you mai be advis that you need to upgrad to a more like sinc there seem to be a conspiraci of ignor about thi issu you ll get no us advic at all most of the store front and mail order sourc i spoke with in attempt to solv my own problem had never heard the term and mani didn t even know what a uart wa even your pc ha ns a uart and ps s do or if you can upgrad your mother com board or add a new com board you mai still experi error and overrun becaus the standard microsoft window com driver don t take full advantag of the window is improv in thi regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrad applic like procomm win which is what i us cannot get around thi problem by themselv if you have a modem card you mai not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be design to be awar of the state of the uart and avoid overrun it howev i wouldn t want to bet that the card design were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever bui a modem card some modem card don t even have convent uart but if thei ar to work with standard window driver thei need to simul on us msd ex below to see what the modem card is or is pretend to be the hardwar situat the uart on most pc com port ar base on nation semiconductor ns or ns chip or megacel insid vlsi chip where you can t replac them you can id the uart type on your system by run the microsoft diagnost program window msd ex be sure to run it in do befor bring up window the window serial api mai prevent msd from accur identifi a if you run it from a window do prompt the ns uart ha separ byte transmit and receiv fifo with configur trigger level and can run reliabl at clock rate up to bp although with current modem technolog there s no point in push your luck by go over bp the ha short access cycl time than the or the also ha dma capabl but it is not clear that ani pc driver ever us thi for more technic info see nation semiconductor applic note an so what uart compon do you have try to locat the uart on your mother board multi function i o card com board or isa mca modem card if you can t find a socket compon with the number or your com port ar probabl buri in vlsi and you won t be abl to perform a chip replac if you can disabl your vlsi com port as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board if you have on or more socket or chip you can bui plug in ns afn or pc c cn low power cmo version ic from sever supplier typic for to each the n chip is the normal pin dual in line packag other style ar avail but avoid ani ns chip without the a the c c ar presum all ok earli ns chip have bug although nation will reportedli exchang those of their own manufactur for free clone chip ar avail from variou ic maker other than nation the manual for the turbocom driver state support for the follow appar equival chip nation semiconductor a chip technolog c texa instrument t c a silicon system m vlsi c turbocom warn about the pre a ns and western digit c sai that problem have been report with earli ibm ps sx and system ibm reportedli will upgrad them if you don t have socket chip you ll need to bui an after market com or multi function board if thi is a modem card situat you mai be hose to add a new com or multi function card you ll need to either disabl the com port s you ar replac or re assign them to com although watch out for irq conflict without turbocom although cheaper card ar avail in the interest of get the problem solv quickli i elect bui the modular circuit technolog mct aio card from jdr microdevic samaritan drive san jose ca voic us voic other fax us the mct aio and the is import sell for it is an bit isa card provid port type connector address and irq comment com db m com irq ns afn in socket com ribbon com irq ns afn in socket parallel db f lpt irq game ribbon the kit includ a ribbon cabl and db f connector for the secondari com port a ribbon cabl connector for the game port two bulkhead plate for the ribbon base connector and a f to f adaptor cabl each port can be individu disabl and the com port have tx rx rt ct dtr dcd and dsr jumper jdr also sell a super i o m f card that also ha id i have heard from sever peopl about less expens m f i o card with s tsd system for the card plu per greenfield trade and distributor voic fax their card is w on w and thei sell afn for r s data system inc east highwai longwood fl phone fax com lpt game card w s for i have no person experi with ani of the firm except jdr meanwhil back at the mct card from jdr i onli need two serial port and am run out of irq on my pc so i disabl my built in vlsi base port howev with the turbocom driver below i could have set the intern as com and us irq share the softwar situat simpli upgrad to uart will not complet solv common overrun problem the standard ms serial driver don t take full advantag of the the window driver ar even less capabl and the window driver have the follow limit thei enabl onli the receiv fifo and onli at rate abov bp thei never enabl the transmit fifo which result in an interrupt rate of x dure upload thei set the trigger level at byte too high it s easi for more byte to arriv befor the driver can read the fifo the port menu of the control panel onli allow speed up to with a v bi modem spars data and text can easili compress or more suggest that a host dte connect rate of bp would be effect the api won t accept rate abov cbr the api won t let do program know there is a there and even if it did do program that aren t awar get littl benefit from a port with the standard driver thei don t allow irq share for com the bio doesn t initi com properli in mani system window provid no workaround for app that don t provid port speed option abov bp these problem ar reportedli not solv in window nt or do and mai or mai not be address in ani window releas after but befor rumor suggest thei mai be solv in window you can get replac driver that solv all of those problem by bui a copi of turbocom current version from bio engin research pacif commwar divis beacon hill lane ashland or voic fax bb mcimail compuserv price wa around as i recal bio eng is not set up to accept credit card so i had to send a check egghead and softwar list turbocom but as far as i know thei don t stock it bio is not a softwar compani per se thei appar need reliabl hi speed serial connect for an in hous instrument applic wrote their own driver discov a market for it revis it to be a gener purpos com driver suit thei recent upgrad it for window it is run time licens i now have my host dte connect rate set to bp most of my datacomm app and i am have zero problem with download i routin see transfer rate that exce bp i am also us bp when link an hp lx to my pc with lossless bi direct i o upload to variou remot system ar anoth matter becaus mani host ar still us antiqu uart and driver note that is still the highest rate that the window port menu in control panel will allow in configur a com port turbocom get around thi by allow you to specifi on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multipl of the rate pass through the window api and dialog box i also have ct rt hardwar flow control enabl and i suggest that you do the same even if you onli ever transfer bit ascii data xon xoff is not a suffici reliabl method of flow control the inform dec standard for xon xoff hysteresi is that the sender mai transmit anoth ye sixteen byte after receipt of the xoff from the receiv system or devic the byte fifo in the is clearli not big enough to let us reli exclus on xon xoff a well respect datacomm engin ha inform me that the s can t realli do ct rt all by itself in the do window environ so us data rate abov mai still be riski even with hardwar flow control a with turbocom can still experi overrun in veri busi system with lot of app run and seriou swap in progress if thi is your situat you mai need to bui a co process com board but thi will cost you more than a turbocom upgrad a review of two such board and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb issu of window sourc magazin i suggest try a turbocom upgrad first and experi with process prioriti and time slice if you ar a power user whose thrash system still run into comm problem close soapbox comment the state of rs c serial datacomm support is an embarrass across the comput industri becaus it is the oldest standard i o interfac the job of design hardwar and write softwar often seem to be assign to the least senior or lowest rank engin at comput compani the design of the averag serial port is at least ten year behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstat vendor i lobbi for improv serial port when thei were do the initi design of a new system that famili of machin wa subsequ introduc with port howev thi is the except few comput compani seem to have ani champion for decent i o you mai as well learn what you can about serial i o becaus thi situat show no sign of improv soon when v fast arriv i expect cri of outrag from window user world wide whose pc sort of work todai with v but will fail miser with v fast without a hardwar buffer uart like the and without softwar driver that us that uart to best advantag a v fast modem will be a wast of monei regard a east harmoni road bob niland suit internet rjn csn org fort collin co compuserv copyright robert j niland all right reserv permiss
