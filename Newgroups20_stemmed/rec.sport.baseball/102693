subject re young catcher sinc i wa the on respons for these diverg thread of approx post go back to the brave could be better off if an injuri happen i mai as well inject a littl more fuel to the flame back at the begin of spring train i though lopez would make the squad easili olson wa still recov from hi late season injuri knee i believ and there were question as to whether he would be abl to plai befor june and then berryhil wa ding up i wa look forward to thi becaus i believ that lopez can hit and field the posit befor last season he wa the brave defens catcher prospect while brian deak wa the brave offens catcher prospect besid olson and berryhil couldn t hit their wai out of a wet cardboard box and don t walk enough to be us but olson recov quickli berryhil recov and the brave went with the two vet i still sai that if on of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldn t have gotten hi job back there is a certain logic to keep olson and berryhil around after all ml catcher ar in short suppli and suffer from wear and tear there ar team out there without on averag ml catcher california and seattl come to mind certainli try to move olson or berryhil through waiver would be unlik to work plu you d have to eat that salari which isn t huge but isn t tiddleywink either i think olson s at about berryhil at but that s onli what i recal ye i think arbitr elig mai have a role to plai in thi also what is it that of the year player aren t elig for arbitr onli the that were on the roster the longest ar elig of cours the system mai chang but the extent of that chang is not yet known from a busi standpoint it mai make sens to keep lopez down until june the first time olson berryhil go on the dl i am still disappoint that lopez isn t on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it come to the brave and the truth is that i d rather see our best team on the field which imo includ lopez of cours todai we plai the cub hopefulli we won t need him as for the schuerholz cox convers i imagin it went like thi rememb thei ve both been gm s the follow is not meant to be read by the humor impair cox ok we ve sent jone down hi field could be a littl smoother besid blauser can hit ok and hi field is better than it us to be schuerholz well we ll have to send niev down too deion just won t sign that basebal onli contract we can t count on him in octob so we have to keep nixon around for the defens besid gorman s not readi to give up on billi hatcher yet onc hatcher s gone and deion sign we can move nixon for franki rodriguez that ought to give us some pitch depth in cox yep that ll be nice too bad deion won t sign ok i ll look for niev when justic start have berri berri er back problem again now what about klesko schuerholz well we ve still got to fork out anoth mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the monei or cabrera i keep dangl sid in front of dal maxwel but somehow he doesn t seem to be the same gm first jeffri for jose and now whiten for clark if he get rid of brian jordan then i d have to believ that he and whitei herzog switch bodi at the winter meet cox ok keep try on bream and i ll wait til the trade deadlin for my hunter klesko platoon mayb i can get a few extra at bat for cabrera while we wait try california if snow start slowli mayb whiteyd will bite on sid and if that doesn t work then perhap sid s knee could be persuad to act up there s alwai the dai dl mwa ha ha ha ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he s not that much better than lemk mayb if he start in richmond he ll start walk more besid if he s go to be arbitr elig better to stretch him out so that we actual get some valu from him befor he make the big buck schuerholz now let s see that leav lopez cox nooooo i gotta keep lopez sure i didn t think olson would recov thi quickli mayb i can talk camin into run into him again schuerholz nope lopez ha gotta go you know that he ll get million in arbitr mai as well put it off that on extra year besid until olson s shown hi stuff a littl bit i can t trade him besid berryhil s a left hand hitter you know how rare that is cox don t you mean a left hand whiffer pretti common if you ask me i mean he made pat border look good in the world seri pat border schuerholz hei you re the on who wouldn t write lopez into the lineup cox well you re the on who went out and got me jeff reardon besid i thought lopez wouldn t be us to our pitch staff s stuff he got some time with them thi spring look pretti good come on sure we onli need to keep on stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichev on we keep will be hurt by mai cox ok ok you made your point keep them both sure on of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win game the pennant the world seri i ll be up there with john mcgraw casei stengel earl weaver oh thei laugh at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with georg bell i ll final get my just reward mwa ha ha ha schuerholz easi bobbi have you been take those happi pill left around by chuck tanner why d you ever hire that gui anyhow cox don t ask me ask ted eric roush fierkelab bchm biochem duke edu i am a marxist of the groucho sort grafitti pari tanstaafl although the internet come close
