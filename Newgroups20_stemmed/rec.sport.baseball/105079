cornel edu tedward cs cornel edu edward ted fischer write for predict the futur it ha been entir meaningless at least if it ha mean we don t know how to find it i did not sai i could predict the futur you most certainli did i realli don t want to get into a didso didnot debat with you but thi is somewhat at the heart of our disagr i did not sai nor did i impli that i could predict the futur you have infer that my comment meant thi and you have base your rebutt of my comment on the fact that statist studi have demonstr that there is no reason basi for predict futur perform in regard to clutch hit sabo samuel sabo is clearli a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch hit samuel becaus you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i d call that predict the futur that is your opinion that sabo is clearli a better hitter than samuel the abov data is for a year period end last season last season samuel bat while sabo hit not park adjust thi season thei ar both hit below albeit sabo with more at bat i will agre that over hi career sabo ha been a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel ha been a better hitter in certain situat than sabo i did not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit i express my opinion that had i been the red manag or even a red fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situat than sabo if you were to have been the red manag at that time i assum you would have had some basi for let sabo hit rather than pinch hit samuel i m sure some of that basi would have util prior perform you just wouldn t have us thi particular aspect of prior perform is thi not correct right i would have us aspect of prior perform which have been shown to be consist in the past overal perform l r split even match hit pitch style all of these will give me some advantag if us properli ah properli ye i see even if all els were equal there would be no advantag gain by look at past clutch perform and in thi case everyth els point to sabo pleas help me what exactli is everyth els that point to sabo well ye you ar awar of it exist you claim to be incap of understand it though i suspect you ar simpli unwil yet you rather forcefulli state the opposit you don t seem to think the work is worth read yet you obvious feel the topic is import i d sai thi is insult i must sai i wa not awar of the public can you email me the inform regard it avail and i guess i must apolog to all of those who have done extens studi on sai suppli side econom i didn t mean to insult you but i never did believ you were on the right path i m sorri for my contrari opinion posit i also regret that i don t have the abil to prove that you ar wrong but you ar i believ that by season s end that chri sabo s bat averag in clutch situat will be significantli lower than hi bat averag in non clutch situat i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see is thi simpli a predict for chri sabo for thi year or is thi a predict for all batter who have over the past few year hit xxx amount wors in the clutch than overal it is what it sai it is if you mean the first then as you sai we ll just have to wait and see but the second is a much stronger statement in fact it suggest a rule we can then test thi rule on past data to see if it work for recent year i think you will agre that if the rule didn t work last year or the year befor that it is unlik to do ani better thi year right the second is your statement not mine i m not go to get into case analysi sure you can find somebodi who hit poorli from and then hit poorli in as well you can also find those who hit poorli from and then hit well in well actual i haven t yet but i m not finish look that is i haven t yet found someon who hit significantli below hi overal bat averag in clutch situat for the year and then revers that relationship in gambler s fallaci unless there is reason to expect consist a run prove noth can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correl from on year to the next i ve seen a detail studi of why i shouldn t expect it to correl nope sorri but if you were interest in a reason why i expect chri sabo s abil to hit in the clutch to correl from on year to the next i think i could if you were interest in a reason why i expect joe carter s abil to hit in the clutch to correl from on year to the next i think i could but you re not interest in that becaus you think that those conclus could onli be valid if thei could be extrapol over the entir basebal popul and thei can t be the stupid wa in refer to a statement which wa stupid and i don t see how you can deni it as for total idiot ye if you prove yourself unwil to even consid evid that might suggest that you ar wrong i would sai the term fit nice the problem here is that i do believ you i accept your work i believ that try to predict futur clutch perform base on prior clutch histori is meaningless no better than a coin toss i actual do accept your work as it happen i also have an opinion that in certain situat for certain player a histori of superior or inferior abil to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such histori could be valid in project futur player perform for that player and chri sabo is on such player so tell me doe the term fit or do you have an open mind well sinc i defer to your statist wisdom i think i must have an open mind now we have to pose the same question to you the beastmast mark singer mss netcom com
