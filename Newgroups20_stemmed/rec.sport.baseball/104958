subject re base load walk give red win in in articl apr cs cornel edu tedward cs cornel edu edward ted fischer write in articl mssc xb i cg netcom com mss netcom com mark singer write sigh here we go again actual sever scdn s state that there were no defin skill that would make a hitter more like to perform better in clutch situat vs non clutch situat howev on might choos to defin clutch right can you defin such a skill must i if i were to sai that bat averag is a predictor that can be us to judg which of two hitter is more like to get a hit on a particular plate appear is that onli valid if i can defin the skill in hit a basebal that s all i ve said except i us the smaller sampl of bat averag in clutch situat and elsewher on thi thread sherri nichol repeat her posit that bat averag in clutch situat is a meaningless statist for predict the futur it ha been entir meaningless at least if it ha mean we don t know how to find it i did not sai i could predict the futur i ve suggest that the statist is not necessarili meaningless here s the data for thi situat non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel if you were to have been the red manag at that time i assum you would have had some basi for let sabo hit rather than pinch hit samuel i m sure some of that basi would have util prior perform you just wouldn t have us thi particular aspect of prior perform is thi not correct i ll try to avoid be insult but it s difficult when you so cavalierli dismiss hundr of hour of work with an i don t pretend to understand but nobodi is deni that there ar peopl who have hit well in the clutch in the past but i challeng you to find a method to predict who will hit well in the clutch in the futur which after all is what you ar claim you can do sinc on more time i did not claim to be abl to predict the futur i said that i accept the abov data as an indic that samuel would have had a better chanc for success in that situat than sabo and i am not dismiss your work i m state my opinion you ar sai that your work render ani opinion to the contrari invalid so that the retent of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work fine we have plenti of data obvious our preconceiv bias must be color our work sinc you know clutch hit is a well defin and consist skill all of our failur not withstand so i challeng you to prove it i guarante you that if you can prove the exist of some form of clutch abil you will have plenti of happi sdcn danc around you i did not sai that clutch hit is well defin i said that the data is signific to me i did not sai that it is a consist skill i have said that it is an indic of perform under a certain set of circumst but you aren t go to win ani support by mere state a posit and claim thei ar stupid so i must be right and big sigh i have not not not not not not not ever call you or anyon els on r s b stupid it is nice howev to see that you will consid the possibl that you actual could have some preconceiv bias yeah hindsight is alwai doesn t that make you bright thi is a stupid argument and you know it ah i knew we could get to the name call and there s that word you like so much a suggest take data from and attempt to come up with some method that predict who hit well in the clutch in if that work we can then attempt to appli it to and beyond wait a minut i thought i first had to defin clutch hit do i or don t i you have made strong statement now back them up or be proven a total idiot i made two statement in my post i am not convinc of your conclus regard clutch hit i would have hit for sabo as for mani of us make a number of written statement through thi media about what we think will happen in basebal i m not shy about it i ll make the statement again i believ that by season s end that chri sabo s bat averag in clutch situat will be significantli lower than hi bat averag in non clutch situat i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see here s anoth on for you in joe carter s bat averag in clutch situat wa significantli below hi bat averag in non clutch situat each year i presum you think thi is random non clutch ab h clutch ab h so what could we expect in from mr carter well hi composit ba through wa through wa through wa so i think we have a pretti good idea of what kind of bat averag he can produc in he hit not surpris huh also in non clutch ab h clutch ab h no thi doesn t prove ani overal statist trend that can be us to predict futur perform across the breadth of major leagu ballplay it just make me think that in joe carter s bat averag in the clutch is not go to be as high as hi ba in non clutch situat as for abov i have plenti of compani john dewan of stat inc is the editor of the scout report wherein the statist regard clutch hit ar compil report and referenc in the text bill jame make numer refer to a player s abil to hit well in the clutch i am not sai that i can predict the futur ani more than thei ar you and other ar sai that your work render their statement and mine meaningless i don t accept that which in your word prove that i am a total idiot stupid total idiot my my such hostil the beastmast mark singer mss netcom com
