bat behind dawson who kill most of the ralli he doesn t finish why do you sai that mark ha driven in and last year mark wa bat second primarili and it wa hi wors year averag wise sinc he is bat either rd or th thi year i predict he will be back up to hi previou standard i think he will be better rbi s is not that much of a stretch sometim us stathead get lucki grace didn t hit behind dawson the entir season but he also finish with onli rbi from nss midwai uchicago edu tue mai the most ballsi predict ever mark mcgwire will hit or more hr thi year nope he slow down and the injuri finish him off didn t even reach but a ballsi predict nonetheless from ecaxron mar lerc nasa gov thu mai baltimor will not fade thei will not win the divis thi year but thei will finish within five game i find the prospect of two oriol win each easier to comprehend than that of two sox no offens i think their pitch is about as good as the divis ha to offer the oriol finish seven game out none of them won though mussina might have had a chanc with better relief and more start nobodi els in the divis is worth a darn thei all finish a minimum of fifteen game out the tribe that s anoth reason to watch baltimor thi year and next thei won t wast mani of those game against the rest of the divis except for the brewer who you probabl forgot you were right the rest of the divis wa thoroughli mediocr the yanke and indian led with win the red sox trail with win none were horribl but four were five or more game below from djohnson caylei uwaterloo ca david johnson date thu aug gmt right that wa me i never said the jai were a cinch to clinch it but i said that milwauke will be more of a threat than baltimor i do think that toronto should win it but after i don t consid anyth a cinch unless you have someth like a game lead with game to go i do think that the jai have the best talent team in the al east and if we had a good or even averag manag we might have a bigger lead right now i also think that the oriol will not plai much better than basebal for the rest of the season you win from king cogsci ucsd edu thu nov in articl nov cs cornel edu you write indian the first and onli season ever predict the cleveland indian will win or more game next year you were right from stvja meteor wisc edu fri sep jose rijo will win the cy young award if he is healthi enough to go at least ip who would have thought he would try to steal a base why risk such an injuri he had ip but didn t win the cy young maddux surpris all the oriol will win game in at least of the next year probabl the last and their pitch staff will have a team era among the best in the al in at least of the next year but not necessarili all the same year as thei win thi on will take a long time to verifi i don t think i want to wait that long but thei won game last year and thei were fifth in the leagu in era not a bad start ben mcdonald will not challeng for an era titl in the next year nor will he have victori either year by challeng i mean finish among the leader be among the leader befor the season is done doesn t count he will probabl never be the pitcher he wa hype to be but is still a decent starter to have look like it he wasn t bad last year just too consist to be an ac so far thi year look like more of the same the philli will give up mani fewer walk if when thei get rid of their bullpen coach ryan i am not predict when or whether thei will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a littl bit of time to adjust befor see the radic chang thei would have a fine pitch staff if thei would just steal rai miller awai from pittsburg the white sox seem to have the same problem but not as bad i honestli can t sai did thei get rid of him their bb total were down last year ricki jordan will have rbi if he start game hit in the or or spot in ani lineup or the spot in a lineup with veri good obp in the hitter thi appli for each of the next year i just don t think he s that good billi ripken will never again hit over with ab so far so good i m definit not wait to check thi on from panix spira cmcl nyu edu fri sep no matter what lou gorman and hi scout sai paul quantril will never

strdev jhuapl edu tue mar ar the o s go to sign cal of is eli s wallet weld shut outgo monei onli wide open for incom cash my predict which you mai make note of valentin is that eli jacob will defer ani seriou negoti on cal ripken s contract until the season is over eli will give cal everi opportun to have hi stat tumbl a bit from last year s pace befor come forth with an offer despit claim that op cy wa design to cal s strength my feel is that the foot left center canyon will cut down on cal s power stat after all it s hard to credibl to offer million year to an all star game mvp al mvp gold glove shortstop basebal deiti but it d be a lot easier to offer a similar salari to an obvious declin but abov averag shortstop who had a career year on full season ago of cours if cal doe match hi number then eli is go to be face with a rather huge and expens problem how much did cal sign for when did he sign if i rememb correctli he got a rather hefti contract despit a weak season and final
