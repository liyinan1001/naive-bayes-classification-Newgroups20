subject re eck vs rickei wa re rickei s whine again from smith ms uki edu brian smith in articl blue ci pitt edu genet pitt edu david m tate write i ve read all of the followup to thi but i thought i d go back to the origin articl to make specif comment about the method jao megatest com john oswalt said he ha obtain the plai by plai record in comput readabl form for everi major leagu basebal game for the past sever year he devis an algorithm which i call sum over situat and wrote a comput program to calcul everi major leagu player contribut us it it work like thi look at everi situat in everi game in a basebal season a situat is determin by in score where the baserunn ar and how mani out there ar for each situat count how mani time the team eventu won the game that the situat occur in and divid by the number of time the situat came up to come up with a valu for that situat thi wa first done by georg lindsei in the late s earli s and report in articl an investig of strategi in basebal author georg r lindsei journal oper research issu volum juli august pp later pete palmer did the same thing us simul season to gener a larger set of data to avoid the kind of small sampl anomali that other peopl have worri about he report thi in the hidden game of basebal with john thorn gari skoog modifi the method a bit and did some work on what he call a valu ad measur base on these situat valu hi were base directli on margin run though not on win probabl these result as appli to the season were report in on of the bill jame basebal abstract book help me out here somebodi for exampl a situat might be in score runner on second and no out there were regular season major leagu game last year with the rocki and marlin there will be more thi year sai thi situat came up in of those and the team ahead won of them then the valu of thi situat is descript of method look at chang in win probabl base on the at bat plu ani baserun and credit debit the player by that amount each time he get a plate appear now for each player sum up all hi at bat and base run valu for the season to obtain an overal valu for that player obvious the sum of all player valu for each game and for the season as a whole will be that s onli becaus you alwai credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher there s no valid involv ok there s a veri big problem here that nobodi ha yet comment on you re ad probabl and probabl don t add run you can add the total team run break down into how mani run joe contribut plu how mani run fred contribut etc but probabl don t work that wai if bob increas hi team s chanc of win by in each of pa that doe not mean that bob increas hi team s chanc of win by in fact it doesn t mean anyth becaus the unit ar screwi i agre and disagre john is sai that the batter effort will result in more win then loss while you ar probabl correct that doe not mean more win then loss it mean someth i would rather have a player who increas my team chanc of win by in each of pa then i would a player who increas my chanc of win by in each of pa thu there appear to me to be an obviou posit associ between john s statist and win game thu befor you disregard thi stat it appear to me that further studi must go into what sort of relationship there is consid an exampl bob hit a out solo hr in the bottom of the first about on your scale he doe the same thing again in the fourth with the score ti for anoth and again in the seventh with the score ti for anoth and final in the ninth to win the game by a score of for a valu of bob hit solo hr in plate appear and wa credit by your method with but what doe that mean wa bob respons for the win certainli not the defens is alwai respons if you includ pitch in that and bob wasn t pitch in fact bob wa onli of the offens which is a lot but not even close to furthermor what about the other team run sai thei all came on solo hr by fred then fred wa hit hr to tie up the game which ar just as valuabl as hr to take the lead see lindsei and fred will himself have accru a good rate or so so fred and bob combin have amass of a win in on game there s clearli a problem here the onli problem here is an insist that these number mean exactli how mani win the team ha first we ar us averag over mani season and appli them to on game second rememb some player perform take awai from the chanc of you win that is a player who get an out get a neg probabl in most case thu i m not sure in ani given game when you add up all the number for a team who won that thei will add up to in that game sometim thei will add up to more then on sometim less than on also the pitcher bad perform give up run mai have given them a larg neg percentag for that game also ani batter that pull an night would give larg neg greg think about the right thing but hi intuit is off the mark closer ar enorm import the total number of run valu is outweigh by when thei come or ar prevent from com the doubl which greg allow is not enough in anoth articl i propos a test of thi we can predict a team s won lost record quit accur by look at how mani run total thei score and allow without regard to when those run score in the game if late run ar realli more import than earli run then look onli at late run should lead to a better predictor right no but realli onli becaus you have a smaller sampl size i would think howev that the number of run you score in the first in would be just as good as a predict as how mani run you score in the last in and realiz someth els a closer usual come in in a close situat not a blow out it is hard to argu that ani run that a closer give up in a game have equal import to those given up in the first in look a closer give up run often mean a team will lose mani game on the other hand a starter who give up run often still leav hi team a chanc to win the offenc ha mani more out to do someth about but i am not sai all late in situat ar equal import either if i am down run in the ninth it realli doe not matter how mani run my pitcher give up in the ninth here s anoth thought experi appli thi method to basketbal what you find is that point score in the first half of the game have almost exactli no valu becaus no lead is safe with an entir half yet to plai furthermor the sub in off the bench who sink the win free throw with no time on the clock get a for the game while the star forward who score point in the first half befor sprain hi ankl get a zero doe thi make sens no but why would you assum that the team probabl of win would be befor the posses in which the free throw were made look if you ar down point with second left there is a fairli high probabl that you will win the game if you ar in posses of the ball and do not forget that somebodi els miss shot turnov foul bad defens etc caus a neg chanc that the team would win from read all of the discuss on thi statist i feel that those who critis it to a certain extent ar do so out of an agenda at first look thi statist valad clutch but it realli doe not cluth revolv around the idea that certain player in crucial situat elev their perform and other perform goe down i ve never seen convinc proof that thi realli happen so if you assum there is no clutch then that mean that except for a lot of noic thi statist ha a posit associ to player perform there is a wai to get rid of the noic if you do not believ in clutch certainli we could find out what the averag valu of a home run is for exampl we mai find for instanc that a home run increas your chanc of win by on averag while a strikeout decreas your chanc of win by i bet if thi were done we would find that thi statist wa just as good as other statist we have for predict win and loss how do we evalu relief pitcher sai john and sam have the exact same pitch statist run earn run k s bb s etc both had except number john howev onli pitch in closer situat while sam wa a mop up man who wa more valubl to their team probabl john who wa the better pitcher thei were probabl about the same brian smith
