subject re sphere from point i plan to post a summari of respons to thi as soon as i have work code which i will also includ the intersect of plane method look best but my implement base on a short articl in graphic gem i doesn t work i mai be misinterpret of cours i had avoid the simultan solut of the plane equat in favor of dot and cross product but the former mai actual be better in either case a matrix determin need to be comput implicitli in the solut of linear equat to get the plane i wa take the midpoint of the line from sai p to p and set the normal as the normal vector from p to p these just plug into the formula in graphic gem howev the result center point is onli occasion equidist from all of my test point for differ test my matrix vector math is veri rusti but it look like i need to verifi the formula or us the simultan equat solut which will requir bring in anoth routin i don t have but should be easi to find anoth method is to first find the center of the circl defin by set of point and intersect the normal from there thi would also defin the circl center howev small numer imprecis would make the line not intersect supposedli plane have to intersect in a uniqu point if thei ar not parallel ed thank to all who answer so far ed bolson univers of washington cardiovascular research bolson u washington edu prefer bolson max bitnet bolson milton u washington edu if you must
