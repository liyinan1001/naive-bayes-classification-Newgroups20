subject sphere from point anoth method is to first find the center of the circl defin by set of point and intersect the normal from there thi would also defin the circl center howev small numer imprecis would make the line not intersect supposedli plane have to intersect in a uniqu point if thei ar not parallel have thought about thi why don t you project the line onto the d plane form by the line do an intersect calcul in the plane in d where you re guarante a uniqu solut unless thei re parallel which won t happen in thi case and then us parametr distanc along the line from the circl centr to determin the exact point of interest thi bypass the messi error propog requir to do the calcul in d hope i haven t put my foot in it again steve steven collin email steve crl hitachi co jp visit comput graphic research phone hitachi central research lab tokyo fax
