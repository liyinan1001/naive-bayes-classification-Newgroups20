subject look for a job as a softwar engin i am not sure that i am suppos to post thi mail here howev dure the last year while i wa involv in develop graphic user interfac gui applic i have enjoi be person part of thi new group wherin i got some interest inform which help me in my work i am post my resum hope that peopl work in my area would make time to look at it a westgat hall isu am ia april dear prospect employ i am seek employ as a softwar engin with interest in softwar design and develop in which i can util my experi in hardwar c c program graphic user interfac gui oper system and comput network i receiv my bachelor of engin be degre in electron engin in and a m s degre in electr engin in dec from iowa state univers current i am enrol in a m s in comput engin at iowa state univers dure my master program as a research assist sinc jan i have publish three paper includ on in the ieee transact on magnet these paper ar a reflect of the qualiti of my research and my abil to learn new concept quickli i have been involv in mani project involv softwar develop and have extens experi program in c c fortran and assembl level i am also familiar with oper system like unix ultrix and ms do i am familiar with motif x program and current as a research assist am involv in graphic user interfac gui design us the multiplatform gui toolkit xvt my experi also includ area such as oper system and comput network through cours work and project i wa involv in the studi of the design and develop of the intern of the xinu oper system i have also been involv in mani tcp ip program project in comput network while in colleg i learnt the import of clear and concis commun i have also learn a lot about time manag in my m s program i have maintain a grade averag work hour per week and have enjoi be involv in mani other extra curricular activ my softwar experi along with my hardwar background electron engin would be veri help in my career goal as a softwar engin i request that my qualif mai kindli be review i would like to have an interview to discuss your employ need and my career goal i am eager to hear from you soon sincer s n rajesh rajsnr iastat edu resum s n rajesh work resid
