subject view on isomorph perspect i m work upon a game us an isometr perspect similar to that us in popul basic you look into a room that look similar to the follow xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing about thi perspect is that you can look and move around in three dimens and still maintain your peripher vision sinc your viewpoint is alwai the same the routin can be hard code for a particular vantag in my case wall two s rise edg ha a slope of i m also us mode x x i ve run into two problem i m sure that other reader have tri thi befor and have perhap formul their own opinion the routin for draw wall were trivial but when i ran a pack planar imag through them i wa dismai by the jaggi i m now consid some anti alias routin speed is not realli necessari is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall alreadi skew thu be assur of nice imag or is thi too much of a burden wall present a problem the algorithm i us tend to overli distort the origin i tri to decid on paper what pixel go where and fail ha anyon come up with method for map a planar to crosswis shear shape current i take and produc line follow the slope line is directli under line line move up a line and left pixel line is under line thi fill the shape exactli without ani unfil pixel but it caus distort ha anyon come up with a better wai perhap it is necessari to simpli draw the origin bitmap alreadi skew ar there ani other particularli sticki problem with thi perspect i wa plan on have hidden plane remov by us z buffer locat ar store in x y z form for those of you who notic the top line of wall and wall ar parallel with it bottom line thi is why there appear to be an optic illus ie it appear to be either the insid or outsid of a cube depend on your mood there ar no vanish point thi simplifi the draw code for object which don t have to chang size as thei move about in the room i ve decid that thi approxim is alright sinc small displac at a larg enough distanc caus veri littl chang in the appar size of an object in a real perspect draw hopefulli the context of the pictur ie chair on the floor torch hang on the wall will dispel ani visual ambigu thank in advanc for ani help till next time o o v o v email pinki tamu edu sam inala v
