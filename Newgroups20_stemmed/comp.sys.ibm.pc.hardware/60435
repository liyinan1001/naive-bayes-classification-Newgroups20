subject re id vs scsi richk grebyn com richard krehbiel write stuff about the connect between id and ida deleat mhz clock bit width mb sec if id speed come from ida where doe the mb s sight for id come from scsi is not complex it is just the wai the industri us and talk about it there ar three kei differ in scsi the control chip the port and the softwar that is it let us look as scsi in from thi stand point scsi asynchron and synchron mode softwar scsi driver onli asynchron is slower then synchron mode onli mb s vs mb s synchron speed can be reach by most scsi divic with a rewrit of the softwar driver as is the case for the mac quadra scsi bit thi is the main sourc for the confus thi differ from scsi onli in the control chip in most machin in the mac and some pc thi is call fast scsi becaus it us scsi port and softwar driver and can produc scsi speed through scsi inspit of thi even in the slower asynchron mode averag speed in asynchron scsi mode mb s with mb s see in both quadra and higher end pc synchron mode just allow a higher burst rate mb s scsi bit two version wide fast wide scsi requir two thing over bit scsi a scsi softwar driver and a wide scsi port on the machin and the extern devic fast scsi also requir two thing over bit scsi scsi driver softwar and that the reciev devis support bit fast scsi speed of both is the same mb s with mb s burst scsi bit also know as wide and fast scsi over bit scsi thi requir scsi driver softwar wide scsi port and that the reciev devic also have a bit mode scsi chip as expect thi is veri expenc speed mb s with mb s burst as i said simpl seven version of scsi seper by softwar the control chip and the port standar the softwar and it drop to onli five version of scsi seper by onli hardwar the chip and the port
