subject re id vs scsi david c cat uucp dave write ar we talk about a scsi devic e g hd on a scsi control or ar we talk about a scsi control that had a chip upgrad us the same chip that is on a scsi control board we ar talk about a scsi devic e g hd on a scsi control here is a rewrit of my mac info sheet scsi section scsi onli extern devic expans interfac common to both mac and ibm allow the us of ani devic hard drive printer scanner nubu card expans mac plu onli some monitor and cd rom normal asynchron scsi is mhz fast synchron scsi is mhz differ between these mode is mainli in the softwar driver main problem there ar a lot of extern devic which ar intern termin which caus problem for more then two devis off the scsi port a scsi chain is suppos to be termin onli at the begin and end ani other set up caus problem for either mac or ibm scsi bit devic per scsi control asynchron mb s av and synchron mb s max transfer bit scsi is often mistaken for a fast version of scsi see scsi for detail scsi fulli scsi compliant scsi mode devic per scsi control bit scsi is impliment as a veri fast scsi sinc it can run us scsi hardwar and softwar driver which limit it to devic which result in it sometim be mistakenli consit part of scsi bit and bit scsi requir differ port electron and scsi softwar driver from scsi which make them more expens than other scsi interfac bit scsi seem to run onli in synchron mode henc term wide and fast scsi transfer speed ar mb s with mb s burst bit mb s with mb s burst bit and mb s with mb s burst bit bit scsi is the biggest headach due to the fact that it is the onli scsi that i know of that can pump scsi speed through scsi devic and softwar control it main impliment is on the mac though you do see add for scsi at mb s maximum throughput for pc sinc bit scsi doe not need all the hardwar includ electon and softwar of bit and bit scsi it is the cheepest of the scsi interfac just pop out the scsi electorn and pop in bit scsi electron some peopl consid bit where scsi realli start i us to be on of them but mb s averag though put with a theoret burst of mb s is not scsi but is bit scsi rule of thumb if it is scsin and over mb s then it is some type of scsi bit scsi can us part of scsi electron which further reduc it cost compar to and bit scsi
