subject help need hello i hope somebodi out here can help me i am current work on a project where i am try to commun from an ibm with phoenix bio us c to a board that i made with an intel cpu with uart chip the board work fine with the transmit command and termin emul mode of kermit but there seem to be someth wrong with the initi or protocol us when i try c i need to access the unit i built us c becaus i have a sizabl chunk of c code that i will be us to perform calcul and oper that will be veri difficult to code in assembl languag for the i have includ the assembl code that i am run and the c code that i am try to us if anyon can show me someth that i am do blatantli incorrectli or that i am miss becaus of my lack of knowledg about rs serial commun pleas e mail me i wrote the assembl languag to wait for a charact to be receiv and then to check it against the x charact if a x is receiv the led will indic thi two c program that i have written do noth but set up com port and send the x charact on us the bioscom function in bio h the other us the softwar interrupt int function in do h i have tripl check the baud rate the pariti none the stop bit the charact length bit and the interrupt call for x current i am at a loss as to what mai be wrong ani hardwar guru out there want to comment thank alot hubert de jesu dejesu eniac sea upenn edu intel asm command equ h command regist on porta equ h port a on timerlo equ h high bit of timer timerhi equ h low bit of timer uartdata equ e h uart data regist uartcmd equ e h uart command regist org h sram locat mvi a h set low timer bit sta timerlo mvi a h set high timer bit sta timerhi mvi a b start timer enabl port a sta command mvi a h displai on segment led sta porta mvi a h clear uart command sta uartcmd sta uartcmd sta uartcmd mvi a b intern reset uart sta uartcmd lda uartdata remov extran data mvi a b init uart for data bit sta uartcmd no pariti stop bit x async mvi a b enabl transmit and receiv sta uartcmd init lda uartcmd read statu regist ani h is rxrdy jz init no loop lda uartdata read data charact cpi is charact x jnz init no loop mvi a h charact receiv sta porta displai on segment led hlt end c us bioscom includ stdio h includ stdlib h includ bio h defin init defin send defin receiv defin statu defin com void main char abyt abyt xa bioscom init abyt com printf initi comm port n while bioscom statu com x abyt bioscom send abyt com printf sent start charact n c us int includ stdio h includ stdlib h includ do h includ bio h main union reg regist regist h ah x regist h al xa regist x dx x int x regist regist printf com initi n regist h ah x regist h al x regist x dx x int x regist regist printf sent start charact n
