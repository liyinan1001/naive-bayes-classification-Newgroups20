subject re id vs scsi wlsmith valv heart rri uwo ca wayn smith write wayn amtow spacecoast org write id also us dma techniqu i believ floppi control also us dma and most a d board also us dma dma is no big deal and ha noth to do directli with scsi no the simpl style id control doe not us dma the cpu perform the data transfer with a string move instruct thi requir that the cpu stop what it had been do and transfer the data onli the smart drive control be thei id or scsi can transfer via dma these control tend to cost the same wether thei ar id or scsi to get the dma benefit id must sacrific it s price advantag on the control for exampl when rewind or format a tape the command is issu to the control and the bu is releas to allow access to other devic on the bu thi greatli increas product or at least do someth els while back up your hard drive which happen to be what i am do while read thi group you can thank your softwar for that if do had a few more brain it could format floppi etc while you were do someth els the hardwar will support it but do at least won t again thi ha noth to do with scsi floppi aren t on the id bu your arguement make no sens thi isn t an id issu the floppi have their own processor on their control board which handl all of these command the differ between id and scsi is that all scsi peripheri ar intellig thei each have their own control thei depend on the cpu to do fewer thing for them i e id drive need a processor to transfer their data it a long stori but i still us id on my except for the cdrom which thank to scsi i can move between both machin if and when scsi is better standard and support on the ibm clone machin i plan to complet get rid of id and if you stick with do you ll wonder why you can t multitask again i ask why can t a unix or os type os do all the miracul thing with an id harddriv that it can with a singl scsi hard drive the dettach callback mechan alow the cpu to make request of the devic on the scsi bu and then dettach and go about it busi later when the devic is done it issu a callback to sai that the data ha arriv or the function ha complet most scsi card will also dma the data into memori without the interupt the cpu therefor allow it to continu work uninterupt id support no such concept as dettach callback can you see how thi would be a win in ani multitask system david willmor willmor iastat edu death befor dishonor better dead than greek david willmor ever notic how much thei look like orchid love
