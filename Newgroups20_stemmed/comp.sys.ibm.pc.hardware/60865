subject upgrad the processor on machin in case anyon wa wonder about upgrad their or class machin without spend a lot of monei i look into replac the processor on those machin and here ar the fact as i understand them if you have a ps model or model you can replac the i chip with either a cyrix dlc chip for which will increas your process power by about for normal fuction and not at all for math function thi chip will onli run at your origin clock speed ie if you have a mhz machin the cyrix dlc will run at mhz note window doe not us the math function so it is a good upgrad if you ar run window or you can get a kingston now platform for with a mhz i sx on it which will increas your normal process power by about if you were run at mhz origin but again it will not increas the speed of your math fuction i think that it will continu to run at mhz even if your origin processor run at a slower speed there is also the kingston now platform for with a mhz i dx on it thi might speed up your math function as well but i am not sure if you have a ps model b or other ps machin with either an i sx or a non clock doubl i dx ie it run at either or mhz in it then you can get an intel overdr chip which is realli an i dx chip and replac your chip with it you should get about better preform for both normal and math function the mhz version of the overdr chip cost and the mhz version cost the replac for the mhz sx chip is an espeaci good deal as it provid the math coprocessor which the sx doe not have note that the speed rate on the overdr chip ar the maximum speed at which thei can run if you have a mhz sx then the overdr chip will run at mhz ie mhz extern and mhz intern there is no reason to bui an overdr chip which is rate at faster then your machin you will not get faster perform you should be abl to bui these chip from ani of the microchip merchant that advertis at the back of pc magazin or pc week you might want to shop around as price do vari if you need a name phone number for a sourc for a particular chip e mail me and i will respond with a coupl of sourc lawrenc khoo khoo husc harvard edu lawrenc khoo comput consult khoo haavelmo harvard edu econ dept harvard u
