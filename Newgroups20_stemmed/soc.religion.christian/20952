subject re sabbath admiss of in articl apr atho rutger edu pharvei quack kfu com paul harvei write prioriti than the direct word of jesu in matt paul begin roman with if someon is weak in the faith do you count yourself as on who is weak in the faith do you count yourself as on who is weak in the faith you read jesu word in matt is there ani doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia miss the mark is there ani doubt in your mind about what is right and what is miss the mark howev i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambigu proof that regular christian worship wa on the first dai as i indic there ar respons on both of the passag cite wherea the ten command and jesu word in matt ar fairli clear ar thei not ar thei clear or do you have doubt no i don t believ that paul can overrul god an import first step the realiz that paul wa human howev paul wa write for a larg gentil audienc ye and he wa write and speak for an audienc that wa at best veri weak in the faith most could not read most were unfamiliar with the hebrew scriptur in even the septuagint form paul adapt the messag of the bibl to a larg uneduc market grant thi market still exist todai but do you count yourself as part of it to be weak in the faith is not miss the mark hamartia if you do the best that your educ allow ar you do the best the law wa regard by jew at the time and now as bind on jew but not on gentil there ar rule that were bind on all human be the so call noachic law but thei ar quit minim let me make clear that the law is none other than the pentateuch of genesi exodu leviticu number deuteronomi what did jesu sai about the law in matt where did jesu sai that the law onli appli to jew and that gentil ar abov the law the issu that the church had to face after jesu death wa what to do about gentil who want to follow christ the decis not to impos the law on them didn t sai that the law wa abolish it simpli acknowledg that fact that it didn t appli to gentil who acknowledg thi fact on what basi ar we extra biblic at thi point why not also acknowledg that the bhagavad gita is the onli relev text for gentil after all we see in the bibl that it wa magu from the east who observ the star sign of jesu why bother with ani text at all why not just follow whatev the church ha to sai thu there is no contradict with mat i don t see how you can sai thi with a straight face ar you a follow of christ or do you follow someon els ar you sai that the word of jesu onli appli to jew as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christian did continu to particip in jewish worship on the sabbath thu thei continu to obei the law how jewish wa paul after he chang hi name from saul the issu wa and is with gentil christian who ar not cover by the law or at least not by the ceremoni aspect of it who sai gentil christian ar not cover by the first five book who sai that gentil christian ar abov the ten command jesu dealt mostli with jew i think we can reason assum that mat wa direct to a jewish audienc you re impli that jesu word ar valid onli for jew is thi realli what you mean to sai you do realiz that you ar gut rather larg portion of the bibl when you read jesu word did you ever consid that mayb just mayb jesu is talk to you no matter what your race or sex if the hebrew scriptur and the gospel account of jesu ar onli direct to jew why were thei translat into english he did interact with gentil a few time e g the centurion whose slave wa heal and a coupl of other the term us to describ the centurion see luke suggest that he wa a god fearer i e a gentil who follow god but had not adopt the whole jewish law as paul would call him on who wa weak in the faith he wa commend by jewish elder as a worthi person and jesu accept him as such thi seem to me to indic that jesu accept the prevail view that gentil need not accept the law which is more import the record word of jesu or indic that you can deduc from the bibl wa jesu god onli of the jew or god of all humankind of all race and sex howev there s more involv if you want to compar jesu and paul on the law in order to get a full pictur of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul s appar reject of the law and how that relat to jesu commend of the law at least as i read paul he sai that the law serv a purpos that ha been in a certain sens superced thi is your understand of paul compar thi to the word of jesu ar you christian or paulin again thi issu isn t on of the abolit of the law in the middl of hi discuss paul note that he might be understood thi wai and assur us that that s not what he intend to sai rather he see the law as primarili be present to convict peopl of their sin but ultim it s an imposs standard and on that ha been superced by christ again thi is your understand of paul did jesu sai that the law wa an imposs standard did jesu sai that he superced the law ar you christian or paulin paul s comment ar not the world s clearest here and not everyon agre with my read you acknowledg that it is your read of paul what did jesu sai can you deni that matt is quit clear in it mean ar you christian or paulin but the interest thing to notic is that even thi radic posit doe not entail an abolit of the law it still remain as an uncompromis standard from which not an iota or dot mai be remov for it purpos of convict of sin it s import that it not be relax when did jesu sai that the purpos of the law wa convict of sin howev for christian it s not the end ultim we live in faith not law pleas reread matt ar you christian or paulin jesu interpret emphas the intent of the law and stai awai from the ceremoni detail ar you sai that the ten command ar ceremoni detail paul s conclus is similar while he talk about the law be superced all of the specif exampl he give involv the ceremoni law such as circumcis and the sabbath he is quit concern about maintain moral standard you call observ of the sabbath the dai on which the lord rest ceremoni ha circumcis been superced for christian ar you christian or paulin both there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not at least not in thi case jesu did not deal explicitli with the question of whether the law wa bind on gentil that s why i have to cite evid such as the wai jesu dealt with the centurion as to gener jewish view on thi i am depend larg on studi of paulin theologi on by h j schoep and on whose author i can t come up with at the moment both author ar jew also variou christian and non christian jew have discuss the issu here and in other newsgroup mat is clear that the law is still valid it doe not sai that it appli to gentil and ye i sai that the specif requir for worship on the sabbath in the ten command is a ceremoni detail when you re look at the oblig of gentil similarli circumcis i m not sure quit what els i can sai on thi subject again it s unfortun the jesu didn t answer the question directli howev we do know what the st cent jewish approach wa how jesu dealt with at least on gentil and how jesu discipl dealt with the issu when it becam more acut i m refer to act more than paul given that these ar all in agreement i don t see that there s a big problem clh
