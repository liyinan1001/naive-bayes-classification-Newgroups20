subject re sabbath admiss of someon sent me thi faq by e mail and i post my respons here i m not enforc the inclus limit on thi faq becaus most of our reader probabl haven t seen it clh christ warn that anyon who break on of the least of these command and teach other to do the same will be call least in the kingdom of heaven matt thi faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintain will remov from it the partisan theologi brother and sister be new to the faith and examin the decalogu close i ve notic the fourth command is pretti specif about keep the sabbath dai it state the th dai saturdai is the sabbath while most christian religion keep or atleast go to church on sundai what s up thi is a frequent ask question everi time it aris it caus month of debat so let me see if i can answer you directli basic it s becaus the law wa given to mose as part of a specif covenan with the jew most of us aren t jew so we aren t part of that coven there wa an argument earli in christian histori about whether the mosaic law should appli to gentil who becam christian you can see the account of thi debat in act the main question there wa circumcis but keep the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostl conclud that we need not becom jew in order to becom christian and therefor that rule such as circumcis did not appli to us the law wa known to man befor it wa reveal on mount sinai rom note that where no law is there is no transgress not onli did sin exist befor sinai eden but the sabbath wa kept befor it wa reveal on sinai ex the problem with the first coven wa not the law but the promis which undergird it god want to perform hi will in the live of the peopl but in their ignor after year of slaveri thei promis what ever he sai to do we will do that is why the new coven is base on better promis heb rather than do awai with the law god promis to put my law in their mind and write them on their heart heb includ the sabbath in the act is select inclus the sabbath wa more import to the jew than circumcis if ani attempt had been made to do awai with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is record in act do not confus the weekli sabbath of the decalogu with the ceremoni sabbath which could occur at ani time of the week and were part of the law ceremoni which wa ad becaus of transgress of the moral law gal israel stand for god s peopl of all time that is why god graft the gentil in roma sai that the adopt the glori the coven the give of the law the servic of god and the promis belong to israelit in explan paul make it clear that be born into israel is not enough for thei ar not all israel which ar of israel v then in gal he sai if ye be christ s then ar ye abraham s seed and heir accord to the promis all christian ar abraham s seed jew israelit not physic for that is not the criterion but spiritu we ar joint heir with jesu base on the promis god made to all hi peopl the israelit while christian agre that the ot law do not all appli to us becaus some of them ar part of a specif covenan with the jew we also expect to see some similar between the thing god expect from the jew and the thing he expect from us after all it s the same god howev there ar sever wai of deal with thi these dai the most common approach is to separ the ot command into moral and ceremoni ceremoni command appli onli to the jew thei ar part of the specif mosaic coven these ar thinsg like the kosher law and circumcis moral law appli to everyon most of the command ar part of the moral law except for the command about the sabbath i believ most peopl who take thi approach would sai that the specif requir to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremoni law but a gener oblig to worship regularli is part of the gener moral law thu christian ar free to choos the specif time we worship peopl would probabl agre but thei ar wrong how can the sabbath command be ceremoni when it is part of a law which predat the ceremoni law you ar not free to choos your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a dai of worship which ha it origin in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a dai which god bless sanctifi and hallow in exchang for on which all church leader agre ha not biblic foundat see sabbath admiss in soc religion christian bibl studi a more radic approach which is gener connect with john calvin and the reform tradit sai that the law as a whole is no longer bind instead we ar entir under grace and our behavior should be guid sole by love portion of the ot law ar still us as guidanc but thei ar not properli speak legal bind on us in practic most peopl who take thi posit do not believ it is safe to leav christian without moral guidannc while we mai no longer be under law as sinner it s not safe for us to go into situat with no principl to guid us we re too good at self justif for that to be safe thu christian do have moral guidanc from thing like jesu teach paul s advic etc these mai not be precis a law but thei serv much the same function as and have larg the same content as the moral law in the previou analysi while calvin would deni that we have a fix legal respons to worship on ani specif dai he would sai that given human weak the disciplin of regular worship is import i do not care what calvin or ani theologian sai my guid is what god sai if be not under the law mean we do not have to keep the law why is it that the onli section of the law we have troubl with is the sabbath command which is the onli on god thought wa import enough to sai rememb if you studi the word deepli you will note that the messag is that we ar no longer under the condemn of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pull me over for speed then in court i ask for merci and the judg doe not throw the book at me but give me grace do i walk out of the court sai i can now go on speed for i am now under grace be under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul add to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefor the law is holi and the command holi and just and good rom in both analys the specif dai is not an issu as a matter of tradit we worship on sundai as a memori of christ s resurrect there s some debat about what act show about earli christian worship the most common analysi is that is show jewish christian continu to go to jewish servic on the sabbath but that specif christian servic were not necessarili held then act show worship on the first dai sundai and i cor also impli gather on that dai there ar a few group that continu to believ christian have to worship on the sabbath saturdai the best known ar the seventh dai adventist and jehovah s wit thei argu that act is not a regular worship servic but a special meet to see paul off and that i cor doesn t explicitli sai it s a regular worship servic do you prefer implic to fact a care studi of the act show that the meet wa on saturdai night and that on sundai morn paul did not go to a worship servic but set off on a long journei by foot to asso in icor there is no wai you can equat lai by him in store with go to a worship servic it s clear that thi issu wa a contest on in paul s time see rom paul s advic is that we should be veri care about judg each other on issu like thi on person see a specif dai as mandat by god while anoth doe not he who observ that specif dai doe it in honor of the lord he who believ hi worship is free of such restrict also doe it in honor of the lord those who believ that the sabbath is still mandat argu that paul is not refer to sabbath worship here note howev col which sai someth similar but briefer it explicitli mention sabbath wrong these ar the sabbath dai of the ceremoni law not the sabbath dai of the moral law there ar some differ among christian about us of the word sabbath origin the term refer to the th dai the jewish dai of worship mani christian now us it to refer to sundai the dai of christian worship thei do thi larg so that thei can appli the th or whatev there ar a coupl of differ number scheme command to it reform tradit doe not do thi it distinguish between the sabbath which is the observ mandat for jew and the lord s dai which is the free christian worship the onli refer i can find to thi in the nt is rev there ar also differ about law regard thi dai mani christian support blue law both in secular law and church law set asid that dai and caus peopl to spend it in worship the more radic anti legal approach see such regul as a return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropri to the free christian worship of the lord s dai why would you prefer to twist and turn reli on differ argument which conflict with each other rather than obei a simpl request from a god who love you enough to die for you jesu di becaus the law could not be chang why bother to die in order to meet the demand of a broken law if all you need to do is chang the law penalti for law break mean the law is immut that is why it is no sin not to follow the demand of the ceremoni law it will alwai be a sin to make fals god to violat god s name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagre but then your opinion ha no weight when place next to the word of god dariu it s not clear how much more need to be said other than the faq i think paul s comment on esteem on dai over anoth rom is probabl all that need to be said i accept that dariu is do what he doe in honor of the lord i just wish he might equal accept that those who esteem all dai alik ar similarli do their best to honor the lord howev i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambigu proof that regular christian worship wa on the first dai as i indic there ar respons on both of the passag cite the difficulti with both of these passag is that thei ar actual about someth els thei both look like thei ar talk about nnregular christian meet but neither explicitli sai and thei gather everi sundai for worship we get variou piec of inform but noth aim at answer thi question act describ christian as particip both in jewish templ worship and in christian communion servic in home obvious the templ worship is on the sabbath act is an exampl of christian particip in them unfortun it doesn t tell us what dai christian met in their hous act despit dariu confus is describ by act as occur on sundai i see no reason to impos modern definit of when dai start when the biblic text is clear about what wa meant the word impli to me that thi wa a normal meet it doesn t sai thei gather to see paul off but that when thei were gather for break bread paul talk about hi upcom travel but that s just not explicit enough to be realli convinc similarli with cor it sai that on the first dai thei should set asid monei for paul s collect now if you want to believ that thei gather special to do thi or that thei did it in their home i can t disprov it but the obviou time for a congreg to take an offer would be when thei normal gather for worship and if thei were expect to do it in their home there would be no reason to mention a specif dai so i think the most obviou read of thi is that on the first dai of everi week simpli mean everi time thei gather for worship i think the reason we have onli implic and not clear statement is that the nt author assum that their reader knew when christian worship wa clh
