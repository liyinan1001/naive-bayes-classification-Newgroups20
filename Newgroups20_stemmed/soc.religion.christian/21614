go their own wai rather than god s wai thei refus an adventur of faith in god which would have given them canaan the homeland of promis god honor their decis and said thei would wander in the desert onli a few mile from the land of promis until thei were all buri in the sand the young decis maker of that fate dai were between twenti and thirti year old and destin to be dead within forti year bleach bone in the desert by the time thei were seventi eighti at the most the live of these wander had been unend sad mose describ it as end each year with a sigh v the fact that thei knew give or take a few month when thei were go to die underscor the meaningless of their exist whatev height of success thei reach thei would be a heap of bleach bone within forti year the onli on to live outsid of that depress of hopeless disbelief were joshua and caleb who had stood against the nation at kadesh and had god s promis of on dai enter the land the forti year period wa final draw to an end the new gener those who were children at kadesh were now grown and eager to take the inherit their parent had refus to enjoi in the light of thi mose prai it is time for a new dai to begin and the dai of miseri to be over all these year as mose had walk with these moan and complain peopl through the wilder of their exil he had carri a doubl burden hi wa not onli the sad of live in less than what could have been but he also knew why thei had chosen as thei had at kadesh the problem wa that thei were ignor of the charact of their god if ask who is your god thei would have describ him as the god who is power when aaron had creat their concept of god in an idol he chose a calf or young bull a symbol of power of viril in their mind god wa the young bull who had impal pharaoh on hi horn and gore egypt s god as he led israel to sinai but when man worship a god of power hi miracl grow thin and even bore after miracl food on the desert floor and water gush miracul from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the god of almighti becom ho hum what s next on the miracl menu and a god of power can be as unpredict as a young bull calf he might be all thei need but then who know if he ha all power he ha a right to do whatev he want whenev he want the onli person these peopl had known who had absolut power wa pharaoh and men s live had hung on the whim of hi mood which could chang with the wind thei believ god could work hi wonder on their behalf but thei did not know him and so could not trust him israel had a god base on what he did hi act mose knew the heart of god the motiv behind the act from the dai of hi encount at the burn bush mose had been fascin by god at sinai he ask to be shown hi glori to know who he realli wa he had seen what god had done he want to know who god wa thi request wa grant and mose wa given a glimps of god s gloriou person he had come to know the heart of god as compass and lovingkind exodu the word lovingkind is not to be understood as a human kind of love it speak of the kind of relationship aris out of the make of a coven it can onli be understood as the love that sai i will never leav you nor forsak you lovingkind is as tenaci as a british bulldog when the world walk out thi love dig in it heel and refus to leav and it is not human romant love base on feel and root in emot it is a love of coven commit and therefor oper quit apart from feel god s love is not an emot that waver dai by dai it is the total commit of hi be to seek our highest and best and to bring us to our fullest potenti as human god doe not see someth good and beauti in us which arous hi feel of love toward us we do not woo him and caus him to fall in love with us if that were the case the first ugli sin thing we did would caus him to reject us he is love and he love us becaus of who he is not becaus of who we ar he doe not love what we do but he is commit to us pursu us down everi blind allei and bypath of foolish he will not let us go hi is a love that is not look for what it can get out of us but a commit love that search for opportun to give to us it is sai to the recipi for as long as we shall live i am for you the god who ha reveal himself to man through scriptur and final in jesu in hi come and in hi death and resurrect is the god who is lovingkind thu he love us and give himself to us he will never leav us nor forsak us tragic mani believ have never seen him as love thei see him as power no on will come to faith by just see miracl miracl point to who he is and that is when faith spring in the heart israel did not see god as lovingkind thei saw hi act of power mose knew hi wai the kind of god he wa and the love that he had for these peopl becaus of their total lack of understand of hi love thei could not trust him to be their strength in take the land faith is born out of know the love he ha for us it is the rest respons to the on who give himself to us he is not the forc and to call him the almighti is to miss hi heart he is love who is the almighti and the infinit forc if man is to make forc or raw power work for him he must depend on know the forrnula and have faith in it but the power that issu from love demand faith in the person of love himself the forti year of meaningless wander wa a monument to a peopl who had never come to know the god of love at thi point with the new gener and the possibl of enjoi all that god promis mose prai vers the languag mose us is reminisc of a babi have slept secur in it mother s love now wake to look up into the delight of her ey it is wake to the conscious of be love watch over care for protect fed and clean dai and night by the mother suppos we were to ask what ha the babi done to deserv thi or have arrang been made for the child to repai the parent for thi inconveni our question would be consid unnatur even immor the child wa conceiv in love anticip and prepar for with love s excit a love that ha been to the gate of death to bring it into be the parent love is uncondit spontan it ha noth to do with the look of the child or it perform so god is love he love us uncondition spontan we were conceiv in hi imagin and fashion after hi imag to be brought to where we ar at thi moment by the blood of the lord jesu it is slander and immor to even ask what we must do to earn and deserv that love the child discov it personhood and ident through the ey and touch through the cuddl of it parent love it is a scientif fact that a babi who is not touch and held will probabl die or if it surviv will have sever emot problem and a person who ha been held and love will still never know the true mean of life without the embrac and knowledg of love from god mose prai that the new gener will learn to wake everi morn rest with total confid in the love of god and will receiv all hi promis and bless with joi and glad significantli mose prai that thei will be satisfi with hi love satisfi in the hebrew languag is a rich pictur word describ be fill with an abund of gourmet food it is also us to describ the earth after the rain ha soak it and all the veget ha receiv enough water mose prai that thei will awaken everi morn to be drench in the life give love of god that sens of satisfact is the lifelong quest of everi man and woman when we ar satisfi in our deepest selv mani of our emot and even our physic problem disappear man seek that sens of satisfact which come from feel that he is fulfil as a human be hi hour have mean which make sens out of the ordinari and mundan apart from god man seek thi satisfact through intellectu pursuit through the excit of the emot and through the feed of hi bodi he will even seek it in religi exercis but man will alwai be dissatisfi until he is respond to the love of the live god onli in know god s love will the rest of life make sens as the forti year drew to a close and the land of promis again becam the inherit to be taken mose prai thi psalm i find it fascin that he should prai and ask god for a daili revel of hi love consid the aw with which the peopl held mose on would think he could have lectur them on the subject of lovingkind and by the knowledg thei gain thei would live in it but mose knew better god is the onli on who can make known to us hi love we won t find it in a religi lectur or a formula which we can learn and us to manipul him nor is it in a beauti poem to titil our emot and give us god feel it is god himself the lover who must open our ey and satisfi us with hi love thi prayer is man in helpless ask god to make the love he is real in our heart mose prayer wa partial answer in the next gener and seen in the exploit of faith which work by love in the book of judg but it would not be answer in it fullest dimens until the come of the holi spirit who pour out the love of god in our heart roman in the histori of the earli church we read of the holi spirit fall upon the believ thi is an ancient express that in modern english mean to give a bear hug it is us in luke to describ the father run to the prodig and fall on hi neck and kiss him the holi spirit is god hug you in your deepest self and smother you with divin kiss at the deepest level of your be thi is not a on time experi to be file in our spiritu resum mose prai that morn by morn we would awaken to the realiz that we ar love the world and much of our religi train ha taught us to perform in order to be accept we have spent far too long live in a state of do in order to find satisfact for ourselv to find accept and love from other and from god we now come humbl to receiv love we cannot earn to be still and let him tell us we ar love to let the holi spirit descend into us pour out the love of god we come in still to think on and repeat hi word of love to our mind which have been jade with the doctrin of perform to be accept we begin to realiz that he love us as we ar and give mean and purpos to all of life i challeng everyon read thi to begin each dai from the moment you open your ey by
