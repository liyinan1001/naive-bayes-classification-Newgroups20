subject when ar two peopl marri listown i have sent thi to mr anderson privat post it onli if you think it of gener interest here is a copi of someth i wrote for anoth list you mai find it relev a listmemb ask what make common law marriag wrong a common law marriag is not necessarili wrong in itself there is noth in the bibl old or new testament about get marri by a preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priest have never had ani connect with wed there is a common notion that the marriag is perform by the clergyman in fact the tradit christian view at least in the west is that the bride and groom ar the minist of the marriag and that the clergyman is there onli as a wit howev the essenti ingredi of a marriag is mutual commit two person ar consid to be marri if and onli if thei have bound themselv by mutual promis to live togeth as husband and wife forsak all other till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concern about who is marri to whom have alwai insist on some kind of public ceremoni is in order that societi and the coupl themselv mai be clear about whether a commit ha been made suppos that we do awai with the public ceremoni the standard vow etc instead we have a man and a woman settl down to live togeth after a year or so the man sai to the woman hei honei it wa great while it last but i think it s time to move on she sai what ar you talk about he sai i am leav you and look for someon prettier and younger she sai but you can t we ar marri he sai what ar you talk about we never got marri she sai i rememb distinctli what you said to me the night we first made love you said my love for you is as deep as the ocean as etern as the star as long as i live i am your utterli and complet when i lie on my deathb my last feebl breath will utter your name my he sai oh that that wa just rhetor just poetri when a man is in a romant mood he is bound to sai all kind of silli thing like that you mustn t take them liter and that is why you have an insist on a formal ceremoni that is a matter of public record the church insist on it becaus it is her duti among other thing to give moral advic and you cannot give a man moral advic about hi relat with a woman if you have no idea who is marri to whom if anybodi and vice versa the state insist on it sinc the state ha a concern with properti right with child care and support and therefor need to know who ha made what commit to whom prospect father in law insist on it becaus thei don t want their daughter seduc and abandon prospect spous insist on it becaus thei want to make sure thei know whether what thei ar hear is a real commit or just poetri and person make vow themselv insist on make them formal and publicli in order that thei mai be clear in their own mind about what it is that thei ar do and mai know themselv that thi is not just rhetor thi is the real thing henc the insist on a formal public explicit avow of the marriag commit the church goe further and insist that when christian marri a clergyman shall be present at the wed and record the vow on behalf of the church not becaus it is imposs to have a valid wed without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the coupl understand what the christian teach about marriag is and that thei ar in fact promis to be marri in a christian sens the church also prefer a standard marriag vow and is wari of let coupl write their own vow for much the same reason that lawyer prefer standard terminolog when thei draw up a will or a contract certain languag ha been repeatedli us in will and on can be sure how the court will interpret it try to sai the same thing in your own word and you mai find that the probat judg s interpret of them is not at all what you intend similarli the church prefer to avoid endless debat about whether you ar my main squeez and i am here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territori as forsak all other and till death do us part thi topic ha come up on the list befor is there ani topic that hasn t on listmemb wa ask if a coupl love each other and ar live togeth isn t that marriag in the ey of god eventu someon ask in that case what is their statu if thei break up is that the moral equival of get a divorc ar thei in a relationship that god forbid either of them to walk out on the origin question said good grief i never thought of that in fact there ar reason ground for suspect that someon who sai we don t need a piec of paper or a ceremoni in front of a judg or a preacher in order to show that we love each other is try to have it both wai to have the advantag of marriag plu the option of chang hi mind with a minimum of bother at thi point someon mai sai none of thi appli to me and my mate we ar quit clear on the fact that we have assum a lifelong commit for better or wors forsak all other till death us do part so in our case no ceremoni is need to thi my repli would be the reason for requir a driver s licens is to keep danger driver off the road what is wrong in itself is not the exist of unlicens driver but the exist of danger driver howev test and licens driver is an obviou and reason mean of pursu the goal of reduc the number of danger driver on the road therefor the state rightli make and enforc such law and you the citizen have a posit moral oblig to refrain from drive without a licens no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you ar back to the origin question we have a listmemb who know a coupl who have been live togeth for around year he ask at what point did thei stop fornic and start be marri i answer at the point if ani where thei both definit and explicitli accept an oblig to be faith to each other for better or wors as long as thei both live if thei have accept such an oblig what ar their reason for not be will to declar it in front of sai a justic of the peac your jame kiefer
