subject re athiest and hell in articl mai geneva rutger edu sun gerri palo uunet uu net gerri palo write between adam and ev and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occur thi involv a gradual dim of conscious of the spiritu world thi wa precis my point from a theolog bent those who live immedi after the flood such as noah ham hi son cush and hi son nimrod had a much stronger appreci of divin wrath thei also had a stronger understand of the true god in fact thi immediaci wa a caus of hardship for some so much so that atla who is seen with heaven rest on hi shoulder but thi is not mere the physic heaven that he is lift it is to put god and the strict spiritu of hi law at a distanc and thu he becam the elev of the heaven thi god made men abl to feel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasur the breaker of hi law it is interest to see that it wa that wa titl emancip or deliver or phoroneu it wa nimrod who invad the patriarch system and abridg the liberti of mankind yet wa worship for have given mani benefit he wa a deliver all right but not as we think of christ as a deliver on deliv from a consciou feel of god s wrath the other actual perform a deliveri from god wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true the question of what happen to human be who di befor christ is an ever present on with christian i am not readi to consign adam or abraham or even cain to etern damnat i don t see the problem from the time of adam those who look forward to the come anoint on and put their faith in the fact that it wa god who wa to do the provis were account as righteou but up to the crucifixion their sin were onli cover not taken awai therefor the dispens of the church view the account of sin the same but see it as a complet action rom s make it clear that it ha alwai been salvat via faith and noth els it is possibl to experi etern in a pass moment the relationship of etern to durat is not simpli on of indefinit extend condit of greenwich mean time i understand what you re try to convei but i don t think i d lai hold of it becaus the scriptur do equat the etern of the second death with the etern of sai the church rule with christ jn tell us what etern life is exactli as you ar correct that it is much more than non cessat of conscious it wa also a standard belief among mani peopl that even the righteou were lost it depend upon your def of lost the elect were lost onli in time as outsid of time thei had been chosen from the foundat of the world existenti we were all born lost but the righteou were in christ and therefor never assuredli lost it would be interest to share in the result of your studi of ancient peopl s idea of life after death mayb thi summer i could find time to put togeth a paper on it i simpli have to bui more book for myself and these older book ar veri expens either that or countless trip to the orient museum mankind fell into mist and dark and at the turn point of time a new light enter into the world the light still grow and we ar develop the ey with which to see by it much new revel and growth in under stand li befor us our new vision and understand is still veri feebl but it contain someth new that will grow in time to embrac that which is old and much more as well couldn t agre with you more our understand of sai eschatolog is clearli clearer than that of sai isaiah but that is not what i wa refer to at thi point i should acknowledg openli my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophi for mani insight that have led me to my view on thi subject the wai you refer to it as doctrin put a modern intellectu color on it i think it wa much less abstract and much more real and spiritu concret a teach that struck much closer to home than our doctrin or teach todai can be receiv no i understand it as you have said thi wa my point i am not so readi to attribut widespread notion in antiqu to simpl dispers from an origin sourc even if thei were pass on the question is to what extent did thei reflect real percept and experi ah thi is it thi is the big question howev i would sai again i think that the best lie is on that ha an appreci amount of truth to it look at satan s twist of god s word when he coerc ev that is a veri interest studi the similar in the midst of great varieti of express of the differ peopl s idea of the time immedi after death testifi to the presenc of an underli realiti ye that is my point but it is a two edg sword for some do not want the underli realiti to be reveal thei were not known as mysteri religion for no reason there wa the public side of them and there wa the privat side that wa so protect that the initi to an oath of death if thei reveal that privat side that is why it is so hard to bring their teach to light the mysteri of iniqu that we find in the bibl correl to thi i think the primari object of the mysteri wa to introduc privat littl by littl under the seal of secreci and sanction of oath what it would not have been safe to openli profess wa the true religion case in point todai might be the mason just a note that thei too worship osiri in egypt who can be trace to nimrod the husband son on the other hand there is on notion firmli embed in christian that origin most definit in a pagan sourc the idea that the human be consist essenti of soul onli and that the soul is creat at birth wa conscious adopt from aristotl whose idea domin christian thought for fifteen hundr year and still doe todai no i disagre with you here gerri i know what you re allud to in that the church primarili the rcc did endors aristotelian philosophi into their worldview but i would disagre with you that it origin in greec if you ar a student of histori you will come to see that much of what greec came to expound to the world as their origin wa just an adulter of that which thei had taken from conquer countri the soul is clearli mention and discuss at length in the egyptian religion as wa the uniti of god and also the triniti of god see if you can find wilkinson s egyptian he realli doe a number on what the greek did to what thei pilfer from the egyptian he wa at onc the father of modern thought and at the same time live dure that darken time when the percept of our etern spiritu be had grown dim i m not knock aristotl or plato or ani other greek thinker it just that there is noth new under the sun inde i should also clarifi that i do not deni that etern irrevoc damnat is a real possibl but the narrow rang in which we conceiv of the decis moment i e after the end of a singl earthli life is not in my mind suffici to embrac the realiti and i think that is why the earli creed were couch in term that did not try to spell it out each ag ha it own focu of theologi the earli church struggl with the trinitarian formul the reform dealt with author todai eschatolog ha had much studi the earli creed do not spell these thing out in detail becaus thei weren t the topic of concern there wa insuffici wisdom accumul thei didn t have the exeget tool that we have todai also each ag seem to have an air of revel to it on ag ha a well tend and cultiv garden in which a particular doctrin is given growth it would be natur for the end of time to have the garden appropri for the growth of eschatolog wouldn t it tangent never end tangent rex
