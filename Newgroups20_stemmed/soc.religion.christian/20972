subject re atheist s view on christian wa re accept jeesu in your heart in articl apr atho rutger edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko write jason smith jason atlastel com wrote the discuss begin why doe the univers exist at all on of the law of natur specifi caus and effect seem to dictat at least to thi layman s mind there must be a causal event no reason altern exist i would argu that causal is actual a properti of spacetim caus preced their effect and i must conced here caus befor effect impli time time is part of spacetim hens the argument would be valid i could return and sai that thi doe not infer the caus and effect relationship be uniqu to thi spacetim but i won t becaus the point is moot doesn t address why which petri pikho address below i also conced that i wa doubli remiss as i assert no reason altern exist an entir subject statement on my part and on that could be invalid given time and further discoveri by the scientist i also understand that a prove a theori doe not necessarili specifi that thi is how it happen but propos a like descript of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with thi understand but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the univers our spacetim emerg from noth scienc ha some good candid for an answer all of which requir someth we christian readili admit to faith the fact that there ar sever candid beli that none ar conclus with out conclus evid we ar left with faith it could even be argu that on of these hypothes mai on dai be proven as best as a non repeat event can be proven but i ask what hold someon todai to the belief that ani or all of them ar correct except by faith a coupl of paragraph delet summari we ask why doe the univers exist i think thi question should actual be split into two part name why is there exist why anyth exist and how did the univers emerg from noth it is clear scienc ha noth to sai about the first question howev is it a meaning question after all i would sai it isn t consid the follow appar it is for mani person henc we have religion the question why anyth exist can be counter by demand answer to a question why there is noth in nothing or in non exist actual both question turn out to be devoid of mean thing that exist do and thing that don t exist don t exist tautolog at it best carefulli examin the origin question and then the counter question the first ask why while the second is a request for definit it doesn t address why someth doe or doe not exist but ask to defin the lack of exist the second question is unanswer inde for how do we identifi someth as noth aren t thei mutual exclus term how do we identifi a state of non exist again thi is near the limit of thi simpl layman s abil to comprehend and i would appreci an explan i might add the worldview of thing that exist do and thing that don t don t is as ground in the realm of the non falsifi as doe the theist s belief in god it is base on the assumpt that there is not a reason for be someth as ultim un support as the posit of there be a reason it veri foundat exist in the same soil as that of on who claim there is a reason we come to thi either i am therefor i am or i am for a reason if the former is a satisfactori answer then you ar done for you ar satisfi and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just begin i serious doubt god could have an answer to thi question time will tell some christian i have talk to have said that actual god is himself the exist howev i see sever problem with thi answer first it inevit lead to the conclus that god is actual all exist good and evil devil and angel us and them thi is pantheism not christian agre it would lead me to question their definit of christian as well anoth answer is that god is the sourc of all exist thi sound much better but i am tempt to ask doe god himself exist then if god is the sourc of hi own exist it can onli mean that he ha in term of human time alwai exist but thi is not the same as the sourc of all exist thi doe not preclud hi exist it onli seek to identifi hi qualiti impli he exist to have qualiti btw the best answer i have heard is that human reason is incap of understand such question be an atheist myself i do not accept such answer sinc i do not have ani other method like the theist we come to a statement of faith for thi posit assum that the evid at hand is conclus note i am not argu against scientif endeavor for scienc is us for understand the univers in which we exist but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspect i seek to understand what exist to understand and appreci the art of the creator i also have discov scienc is an inadequ tool to answer why it appear that m pihko agre as we shall see but becaus a tool is inadequ to answer a question doe not preclud the question assert that why is an invalid question doe not provid an answer as far as i can tell the veri law of natur demand a why that isn t true of someth outsid of natur i e super natur thi is not true scienc is a collect of model tell us how not why someth happen i cannot see ani good reason why the why question would be bound onli to natur thing assum that the supernatur domain exist if supernatur be exist it is as appropri to ask why thei do so as it is to ask why we exist my apolog i wa us why as why did thi come to be why did pre exist becom exist why did pre spacetim becom spacetim but we come to the admiss that scienc fail to answer why becaus it can t be answer in the realm of modern scienc doe that make the question invalid i don t believ ani technolog would be abl to produc that necessari spark of life despit have all of the part avail just my opinion thi opinion is also call vital name that live system ar somehow fundament differ from inanim system do christian in gener adopt thi posit what would happen when scientist announc thei have creat primit life sai small bacteria in a lab i suppos we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicu wa vindic befor someon start jump up and down scream inquisit note i said vindic i certainli hope we ve gotten beyond the shoot the messeng stage m pihko doe present a good point though we mai need to ask what do i as an individu christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the product of evid that shatter our sacr cow or will we seek to understand if a new discoveri truli disagre with what god said and continu to sai in hi word why do i ask why apolog to budweis and compani jason jason d smith jason atlastel com i m not young enough to know everyth x
