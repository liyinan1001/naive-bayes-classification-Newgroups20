subject re arsenokoitai nt mean of meta exegesi convict of sin part ii let me return to the question stipul that paul meant hi us of arseonkoitai to refer more or less exactli to the levit prohibit of male male sex in order to bring out the problem most clearli i ll also stipul what i think is far less plausibl that paul coin the term for thi usag the question i want to turn to is what that would mean for paul s reader and for later christian thi should be shorter than my last note as we will see that thi question rapidli confront us with some of the major divis within christ s bodi and i am not try to open the gate for flame across ani of the terribl chasm that separ ani of us from our fellow christian my own bias loos characteriz as liber will be evid but i am not grind an ax here so much as try to get all parti to see that it mai be hard to reach closur when the issu involv strike at the heart of what we each in our own differ wai see as crucial to the gospel of christ so stipul paul s intent the immedi question is how can hi reader understand thi intent and follow on that question there is a second on what is our proper action if we do manag to understand him sinc paul give not a singl clue about hi mean in the text of st corinthian there ar two posit answer and on neg to thi question a paul or apollo or someon in the apostol commun ha convei to the corinthian the then tradit jewish condem nation of homosexu behavior and paul expect them to be suffici well tutor by thi tradit that he need no futher explan i should note that there is no evid in the letter or in corinthian for such a supposit b the spirit will teach us what paul mean or if not paul what god mean behind paul s inspir word choic c we don t know and cannot guess to within ani better pre cision here than for comparison in the parallel us by paul in the same passag of the word pleonektai those who have more if you think that areseonkoitai is obviou from it root try cut your teeth on thi word the neb translat it as grabber or even methusoi drunkard at least thi ha the advantag of be a common insult so that at least there is some hint as to it mean the three posit more or less if i can be allow some exagger for the sake of argument defin a classic cathol attitud toward tradit on form of protest sola scriptura and a liber critic demand for evid all three posit have strength and weak ad a it is unquestion that the gospel wa preach in and by the commun of christ s discipl and their successor and that our nt scriptur itself emerg from thi commun tradit but it s also the case that we know littl or noth about thi tradit until almost a centuri after paul which is to sai that we have access to the tradit onli after sever gener of possibl confus transmiss the scriptur is itself our onli document of the tradit in the critic era ad b if we ar not born of water and spirit to revert to john in an attempt to explain paul then we have no more hope of under stand the gospel than nicodemu had neither the tradit of men nor the vain elev of our own reason can prevent the spirit from blow where it will the paraclet is a kamikaz but the downsid of protest belief in the efficaci of the spirit as our guid in scriptur is that the wing of protestant that take thi most serious is also the most fragment over diverg understand supposedli deriv from the clear word of god note classic lutheran calvinist and anglican thought constrain scriptur to be read within tradit even while reserv judgment against tradit out of scriptur the more bizarr form of i will read scriptur my wai ar primarili a fring aspect of cultic protestant the main problem with thi approach is that there is appar no mean for on person to convei to anoth what that on mai feel is teach receiv from the spirit and histori show incred conflict between christian on thi point each in hi own mind convinc that he is led by the spirit no on can serious urg point b without some sens of it potenti for set christian against christian to what purpos ad c the critic approach ha the distinct advantag that when it can reach a conclus it can lai out the data in a wai which is open to all the weak is an obviou corollari thi is not usual possibl if i mai sai a word here out of my own alreadi acknowledg bia on complaint against critic methodolog is that it dissolv faith but sure a faith that cannot honestli face the evalu ation of evid ha problem which mere theologi is helpless to address anywai there is a seriou and unfortun possibl of schism between liber and conserv posit mostli on the basi of extrem zealot of posit b and c a cathol sens of author and tradit tend to constrain argument of b contra c to secondari posit so that despit horrend strain rome is not as like to find these issu as ultim divis as the protest world will and anglican will i predict muddl through on the via media attempt to give each posit it due but no more than it due second question suppos tradit tell us and lot of spiritu christian tell us and critic thought at least admit as possibl that paul is refer to a flat univers levit prohibit against male male sex what then again we can abdic our person responsi biliti to tradit and let it dictat the answer but it s precis where inherit tradit ar not question that thei re most danger we have exampl of christ question the pharise and their us of tradit despit hi urg in matthew that we ar to heed them we have exampl of peter and more radic still paul jettison the tradit that thei were led by the spirit to call into question jesu and peter and paul do not so much throw out tradit as subject it to radic critic on a coupl of veri basic ground the weightier demand of the law justic and merci and good faith matthew and on these two command love god neighbor hand the whole law and the prophet also matthew if there is a fundament becaus deriv from christ valid in the challeng to some tradit a valid that led the first gener to go so far as to waiv applic of the torah to gentil convert vastli beyond anyth that is directli deduc from jesu report word and deed it signifi to me a certain failur of the imagin to postul that onli the tradit that we have specif challeng against ar in fact open to challeng all tradit pass through men ar tradit of men that god mai lead us even so that these tradit ar a sourc of our spiritu instruct i will freeli grant but tradit is inher human and inher corrupt and given the fall corrupt noth in it is immun to challeng when the spirit show us a failur in justic merci and good faith noth mai ultim stand unless it doe follow from love of god and love of neighbor i am perfectli will to grant that i could be blind to my own sin that the spirit mai have taught anoth what she refus to teach me or i am too dens to learn that tradit might have valu here but what i know of tradit is that on on occas some superstiti christian appeal to justinian after an earthquak in asia minor and scapego sodomit as the caus of the earthquak so that legisl wa pass make homosexu behavior a capit offens if that is in accord with the gospel of christ then i am no christian that is human tradit at it most hate and viciou and i see noth all that much differ in all the unbidden erupt onto usenet of peopl who ar quick to condemn but slow to understand if that is the lead of the spirit then i want no part of it but what i have found in obedi to the lord is that i am myself total depend on the wit of other christian for the truth that live in the bodi of christ and i sai to all who doubt that gai christian is from god what gamaliel said to doubt pharise who would have suppress the earliest church be care how you deal with these peopl if thi enterpris thi movement of their is of human origin it will break up of it own accord but if it doe in fact come from god you will not onli be unabl to destroi them but you might find yourselv fight against god act all i ask is that you listen to your tradit and read your scriptur with a mind and soul open to the spirit and to the past histori of our first christian wit willing to challeng tradit and other read of scriptur though read with all the author of scribe and rabbi and a submiss to the declar that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor then studi the evid learn the histori of christian oppress christian out of their tradit and eager to judg where jesu and paul tell us not to judg and let the wit of the spirit in the live of your fellow christian includ those who ar not of your prefer in theologi guid you toward god s truth michael l siemon i sai you ar god son of the ml panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall ml ulyss att com like ani princ psalm there s a certain ambigu in your discuss of posit a as to whether you re speak of tradit in paul s time or our i think there ar two wai to us tradit on is to sai that when paul and hi reader share a tradit it make sens to interpret hi word in the context of that share tradit that s what make me think that these argument over word turn out to be silli we know that paul came out of a background that wa rather puritan on sex everyth els he sai on sex is consist with that background the tone of hi remark on homosexu in rom is consist with that background even if the word in the sin list aren t the most gener term for homosexu activ and it seem to me that there s some evid that thei ar not thei ar just on more piec of evid for someth we would probabl be will to believ with no evid at all that paul share the common jewish reject of homosexu but when you identifi a with the cathol posit that s rather a hors of a differ color the cathol posit involv a continu church tradit argument specif to that tradit might be we can get guidanc on how to interpret paul s origin mean from tradit e g the wai the church father interpret him and we gain confid that hi prohibit still appli in our time becaus of the univers judgement of the church between hi time and our i think thi is a somewhat differ us of tradit a radic protest might be will to us known st cent tradit to illumin paul s origin mean but not us the cathol posit to answer the question of what our own attitud to homosexu should be clh
