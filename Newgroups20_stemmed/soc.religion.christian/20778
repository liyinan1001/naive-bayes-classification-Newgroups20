subject re atheist s view on christian wa re accept jeesu in your heart first i thank collect all peopl who have given good answer to my question in my follow up to jason smith s post i will address some issu that have caus misunderstand jason smith jason atlastel com wrote in articl apr atho rutger edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko write i also conced that i wa doubli remiss as i assert no reason altern exist an entir subject statement on my part and on that could be invalid given time and further discoveri by the scientist i also understand that a prove a theori doe not necessarili specifi that thi is how it happen but propos a like descript of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with thi understand ye to some degre there wa an excel discuss in sci skeptic on the natur of scientif work two week ago i hope it did not escap your notic the correct word is like there is no wai to be sure our model and theori ar absolut correct theori ar back up by evid but not prove no theori can be true in a mathemat sens howev theori ar not mere descript or rationalis of phenomena it is extrem import to test whether theori can predict someth new or not yet observ all success theori scienc ha come up with have pass thi test includ the big bang theori of cosmic evolut the theori of natur select etc it doe not mean thei must be correct but thei ar not mere best fit for the data but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the univers our spacetim emerg from noth scienc ha some good candid for an answer all of which requir someth we christian readili admit to faith well ye if you want to believ in them thi is not what scienc requir take a good look at the theori and the evid see if the theori ha made ani success predict and us your reason disbeliev ar not punish the fact that there ar sever candid beli that none ar conclus with out conclus evid we ar left with faith thi is what puzzl me why do we need to have faith in anyth my fellow atheist would call me a weak atheist someon who is unabl to believ ie fail to entertain ani belief in god ye i know that on can t believ without god s help luther make thi quit clear in hi letter to erasmu i m afraid thi doe not chang my situat a coupl of paragraph delet summari we ask why doe the univers exist i think thi question should actual be split into two part name why is there exist why anyth exist and how did the univers emerg from noth delet the question why anyth exist can be counter by demand answer to a question why there is noth in nothing or in non exist actual both question turn out to be devoid of mean thing that exist do and thing that don t exist don t exist tautolog at it best carefulli examin the origin question and then the counter question the first ask why while the second is a request for definit no it is not although it doe look like on thi is a true dichotomi either someth exist or noth exist if noth exist nobodi would ask why if someth exist it is possibl to ask why but actual no exist be could give an answer imagin for a moment that the nobodi in non exist could also ask why noth exist thi is equival to my counter question why noth exist in nothing now why anyth exist is equival to why someth exist in something thi is what i meant with my tautolog my apolog for the poor word in my previou post i might add the worldview of thing that exist do and thing that don t don t is as ground in the realm of the non falsifi as doe the theist s belief in god it is base on the assumpt that there is not a reason for be someth as ultim un support as the posit of there be a reason it veri foundat exist in the same soil as that of on who claim there is a reason i do inde think there probabl is no reason for be or exist in gener for reason i state abov howev thei will still leav open the question why thi and not that and thi is where theistic explan come in scienc cannot give reason for ani particular human be s exist we come to thi either i am therefor i am or i am for a reason thi is a deep philosoph question is determin true or not also is god determinist or not i tend to think thi question ha no mean in hi case if i am for a reason i ve yet fail to see what it would be from our perspect it look like i exist for truli random reason i just roll two dice why did i get and how can i believ there is ani better reason for my exist if the former is a satisfactori answer then you ar done for you ar satisfi and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just begin ye i am satisfi with thi reason until i find someth better my year of christian were of no help in thi respect i have to admit but i am patient anoth answer is that god is the sourc of all exist thi sound much better but i am tempt to ask doe god himself exist then if god is the sourc of hi own exist it can onli mean that he ha in term of human time alwai exist but thi is not the same as the sourc of all exist thi doe not preclud hi exist it onli seek to identifi hi qualiti impli he exist to have qualiti btw no it doesn t but i think an exist god cannot know why he exist for an answer to thi question is not knowabl of cours thi should not be ani obstacl to belief in hi exist i also have discov scienc is an inadequ tool to answer why it appear that m pihko agre as we shall see but becaus a tool is inadequ to answer a question doe not preclud the question assert that why is an invalid question doe not provid an answer it is imposs to know unknow thing howev the question why do i exist in particular is not an invalid question thi is not what i said but from our perspect it is imposs to tell and i can t just believ in ani given explan instead of anoth especi sinc i found i wa delud myself my apolog i wa us why as why did thi come to be why did pre exist becom exist why did pre spacetim becom spacetim i think pre exist is an oxymoron there is no time outsid of thi spacetim except in some other univers and from that perspect our univers never wa it exist onli for those who ar insid it but we come to the admiss that scienc fail to answer why becaus it can t be answer in the realm of modern scienc doe that make the question invalid no the valid of the question ha to be discuss separ i think philosophi is of great help here what can be known and what is not knowabl m pihko doe present a good point though we mai need to ask what do i as an individu christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the product of evid that shatter our sacr cow or will we seek to understand if a new discoveri truli disagre with what god said and continu to sai in hi word thi is a veri good question in try to answer thi and numer other question that bother me i final found noth to base my faith on i think it would be honest if we all ask ourselv why do i believ or why i don t believ petri petri pihko kem pmp mathemat is the truth pihati c finou oulu fi physic is the rule of sf oulu kempmp the game finland phoenix oulu fi chemistri is the game
