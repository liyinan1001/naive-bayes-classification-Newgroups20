of doctrin by the trickeri of men in the cun crafti of deceit plot disun contrari to popular opinion isn t caus by expos error it s caus by error zane there ar mani who probabl give no place for see the scriptur as document a spiritu develop or growth in it writer but i would suggest that the fieri paul of the letter to the galatian mellow and matur into the on who lose all for the sake of love in the end my repli most scholar believ paul wrote timothi last let s examin hi admonit to tim to ascertain how mellow he had becom ti hold fast the pattern of sound word which you have heard from me in faith and love which ar in christ jesu that good thing which wa commit to you keep by the holi spirit who dwell in us thi you know that all those in asia have turn awai from me among whom ar

a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentl to all abl to teach patient in humil correct those who ar in opposit if god perhap will grant them repent so that thei mai know the truth and that thei mai come to their sens and escap the snare of the devil have been taken captiv by him to do hi will ti for of thi sort ar those who creep into household and make captiv of gullibl women load down with sin led awai by variou lust alwai learn and never abl to come to the knowledg of the truth now as jann and jambr resist mose so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt mind disapprov concern the faith but thei will progress no further for their folli will be manifest to all as their also wa ti ye and all who desir to live godli in christ jesu will suffer persecut but evil men and impostor will grow wors and wors deceiv and be deceiv but you must continu in the thing which you have learn and been assur of know from whom you have learn them and that from childhood you have known the holi scriptur which ar abl to make you wise for salvat through faith which is in christ jesu all scriptur is given by inspir of god and is profit for doctrin for reproof for correct for instruct in righteous that the man of god mai be complet thoroughli equip for everi good work ti preach the word be readi in season and out of season convinc rebuk exhort with all longsuff and teach for the time will come when thei will not endur sound doctrin but accord to their own desir becaus thei have itch ear thei will heap up for themselv teacher and thei will turn their ear awai from the truth and be turn asid to fabl but you be watch in all thing endur afflict do the work of an evangelist fulfil your ministri ti alexand the coppersmith did me much harm mai the lord repai him accord to hi work you also must bewar of him for he ha greatli resist our word zane the pictur i have of paul is not of on who goe out of hi wai to destroi the ministri of wolv but of on who teach the sheep with mani tear the necess of absolut not allow themselv to be transform into wolv to protect themselv my repli act therefor i testifi to you thi dai that i am innoc of the blood of all men for i have not shun to declar to you the whole counsel of god therefor take heed to yourselv and to all the flock among which the holi spirit ha made you overs to shepherd the church of god which he purchas with hi own blood for i know thi that after my departur savag wolv will come in among you not spare the flock also from among yourselv men will rise up speak pervers thing to draw awai the discipl after themselv therefor watch and rememb that for three year i did not ceas to warn everyon night and dai with tear zane for all the warn paul doe it is of note that he never onc drop a name of a wolf but i will admit he cri in hi beard at the end over those who have abandon him everyon in asia wasn t it my repli paul mention name ti thi charg i commit to you son timothi accord to the propheci previous made concern you that by them you mai wage the good warfar have faith and a good conscienc which some have reject concern the faith have suffer shipwreck of whom ar hymenaeu and alexand whom i deliv to satan that thei mai learn not to blasphem ti thi you know that all those in asia have turn awai from me among whom ar phygellu and hermogen ti but shun profan and idl babbl for thei will increas to more ungodli and their messag will spread like cancer hymenaeu and philetu ar of thi sort who have strai concern the truth sai that the resurrect is alreadi past and thei overthrow the faith of some ti for dema ha forsaken me have love thi present world and ha depart for thessalonica crescen for galatia titu for dalmatia ti alexand the coppersmith did me much harm mai the lord repai him accord to hi work you also must bewar of him for he ha greatli resist our word so did john jo i wrote to the church but diotreph who love to have the preemin among them doe not receiv us therefor if i come i will call to mind hi deed which he doe prate against us with malici word and not content with that he himself doe not receiv the brethren and forbid those who wish to put them out of the church jesu also singl out teach and doctrin rev but i have a few thing against you becaus you have there those who hold the doctrin of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbl block befor the children of israel to eat thing sacrif to idol and to commit sexual immor thu you also have those who hold the doctrin of the nicolaitan which thing i hate repent or els i will come to you quickli and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth rev nevertheless i have a few thing against you becaus you allow that woman jezebel who call herself a prophetess to teach and seduc my servant to commit sexual immor and eat thing sacrif to idol and i gave her time to repent of her sexual immor and she did not repent inde i will cast her into a sickb and those who commit adulteri with her into great tribul unless thei repent of their deed i will kill her children with death and all the church shall know that i am he who search the mind and heart and i will give to each on of you accord to your work zane i question too the purpos of those who write book and build ministri on the fault deliber or otherwis of other mayb if thei would wander around in the desert eat locust and honei or bare cake with no worldli good at stake monei to be made or no reput to maintain i would question their motiv consciou or otherwis less my repli i won t comment on thi becaus it deal with the intang motiv of other but even if thei had bad motiv rememb what paul said phi some inde preach christ even from envi and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambit not sincer suppos to add afflict to my chain but the latter out of love know that i am appoint for the defens of the gospel what then onli that in everi wai whether in pretens or in truth christ is preach and in thi i rejoic ye and will rejoic zane if we want to be true to the admonit of scriptur mani of which you list about protect ourselv and the flock from wolv and wind of doctrin i suggest we start by allow the wolf program in our own noetic pastur to be nail to the cross my repli pleas explain zane secondli i suggest ani heresi hunt be restrict to our own fellowship which in the strict scriptur sens is the local citi church my repli if heresi wa not be propag over the mass media then it mai not be need to go mass media with the exposur unfortun heresi is be taught not just in copeland s church or hagin s or hinn s or price s but all over the radio in print etc no pastor or church leader know what materi the sheep ar feed on outsid the church it s imper that leadership be made awar of thi and cic doe just that also let s examin a passag of scriptur eph and he himself gave some to be apostl some prophet some evangelist and some pastor and teacher eph for the equip of the saint for the work of ministri for the edifi of the bodi of christ these ministri gift that the lord instal in the church ar not just for on individu church but for the bodi of christ paul wa an apostl he travel all over distil hi messag he wa also a teacher co for thi reason i have sent timothi to you who is my belov and faith son in the lord who will remind you of my wai in christ as i teach everywher in everi church co but as god ha distribut to each on as the lord ha call each on so let him walk and so i ordain in all the church also co and god ha appoint these in the church first apostl second prophet third teacher after that miracl then gift of heal help administr varieti of tongu eph till we all come to the uniti of the faith and of the knowledg of the son of god to a perfect man to the measur of the statur of the full of christ notic that the five fold ministri ar go to be around till the church is in uniti of the faith and of the knowledg of the son of god to a perfect man thi i believ will not occur fulli until the lord jesu return see cor but god want the bodi to continu on matur what hinder matur and uniti of the bodi eph that we should no longer be children toss to and fro and carri about with everi wind of doctrin by the trickeri of men in the cun crafti of deceit plot it s clear that fals doctrin integr into the church by the trickeri of men caus disun the thing we ar strive for and spiritu immatur the church continu in spiritu childhood when christian ar toss to and fro and carri about with everi wind of doctrin the five fold ministri of which there doe not appear to be clear scriptur denomin boundari pastor appear respons for their individu flock is to deal with these doctrin when necessari in their struggl to equip the bodi all believ ar call to do thi to a degre jud belov while i wa veri dilig to write to you concern our common salvat i found it necessari to write to you exhort you to contend earnestli for the faith which wa onc for all deliv to the saint for certain men have crept in unnot who long ago were mark out for thi condemn ungodli men who turn the grace of our god into lewd and deni the onli lord god and our lord jesu christ zane if you ll notic in scriptur the heresi hunter that went from church to church and area to area were the bad gui and thei went after the good gui name paul who thei consid to be the arch heret my repli thei were themselv heret try to discredit paul who wa preach contrari to what thei taught zane let s face it the wolv ar here for a reason and we ar here for the reason and let s hope the wolv becom sheep and the sheep lamb my repli ye ti and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentl to all abl to teach patient in humil correct those who ar in opposit if god perhap will grant them repent so that thei mai know the truth and that thei mai come to their sens and escap the snare of the devil have been taken captiv by him to do hi will amen frank if on wish to contend with him he could not answer him on time out of a thousand job
