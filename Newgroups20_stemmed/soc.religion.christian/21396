subject god moral and massacr a listmemb d andrew killi i think wrote in respons to the suggest that genocid mai sometim be the will of god ani god who work that wai is indescrib evil and unworthi of my worship or faith nobuya higgi higashiyama repli as in substanc did other where is your sourc of moral standard by which you judg god s behavior it is often argu that we have no stand by which to judg god s action who is the clai to talk back to the potter but we find a contrari view in scriptur when god propos to destroi the citi of sodom genesi abraham sai suppos that there ar some good men in the citi will you destroi the righteou along with the wick far be it from you lord to do such a thing shall not the judg of all the earth do right i am told that the hebrew is actual a bit stronger than thi and can perhap be better render dynam equival as shame on you lord if you do such a thing there ar those who sai that the definit of good is whatev god happen to want but if that is so then the statement that god is good ha no mean it simpli sai that god doe what he want that be the case no on can either love or obei god becaus he is good the onli motiv left for obei him is that he is power just as it make sens to obei a dictat even when he tell you to round up all jew and extermin them becaus if you defi him you might end up in the ga chamber yourself so it make sens to obei god becaus he ha the power to punish you if you don t thi ethic theori i take to be in radic contradict to genesi and to christian in gener ani theori that make our moral judgement worthless make ani further discuss of moral or of the good of god meaningless howev it doe not follow that our moral judgement ar alwai infal in particular case still less our judgement in particular case about the cours of action most like to achiev a good result when i read the scriptur account of the action of god in histori those action often seem to me veri differ from what i might expect of a god who love us and desir what is best for us moreov leav the scriptur asid and consid the natur world i find that natur is often veri differ from what i might expect if it were the work of a benevol deiti origen said those who believ that the author of natur is also the author of the scriptur must expect to find in the scriptur the same sort of difficulti that thei find in natur now that some such difficulti should exist is not in itself an argument against the exist power wisdom and good of god on the contrari their absenc would be such an argument suppos that i am watch bobbi fisher plai chess and suppos that everi time he make a move i find myself nod and sai good move just what i wa expect him to do same move i would have made if i were plai that would be a sign that fisher is no better a chess player than myself given that he is better i expect that at least some of hi move will have me think now what do suppos induc him to do that or even boi that wa a real slip he s just thrown the game awai similarli if god understand the work of the univers better than i do it is to be expect that sometim it will look to me as if he ha made a mistak on differ between fisher at the chessboard and god at the control of the univers is that i can see the end of the chess game if fisher win i revis my earlier infer that it wa careless that made him lose hi queen move earlier howev if he lose and particularli if i can see that there wa a time when he had an opportun for a checkmat in two move and did not take it then i know that he is not as good a player as i had thought with god on the other hand i shall not in thi life see the total result of some of hi action therefor my ground for judg that i have seen a bad move on hi part must alwai be far shakier than my ground for make a similar judgement about fisher in the book of genesi we read that joseph s ten older brother who with good reason found him insuffer conspir to sell him into slaveri in egypt there he eventu becam viceroi and when there wa a famin in canaan he wa abl to provid for hi famili when hi brother nervous apolog he told them do not worri you meant to do me evil but god turn it into good i onc heard a rabbi speak on thi text he said the histori of the jew is larg a histori of event that look like catastroph that threaten the continu surviv of the religion or the peopl or both but amazingli those event turn out to be the save of the jew and of judaism the sale of joseph by hi brother look like the breakup of the famili but in fact it end with a reconcili of the quarrel between them the famin that drove the famili out of canaan look like a misfortun for them but in fact if thei had stai in canaan thei would almost certainli have intermarri with the canaanit and been assimil into their cultur their oppress by the egyptian a few gener after their arriv in egypt again look like a disast but god us it to bring them out of egypt and into the promis land here the peopl built a templ and regularli offer sacrific but the babylonian captur jerusalem and judea destroi templ and citi and countrysid and deport most of the peopl to babylon you might have thought that that would be the end of the peopl and the religion but it wa not live in canaan the peopl had been under constant danger of assimil again and again thei had turn from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanit fertil cult with their ritual prostitut and ritual human sacrific the babylonian captiv put a stop to that never again did the jew show ani interest in polyth or idolatri neither the worship of the canaanit mor that of the babylonian ever again had a foothold among them nor is that all judaism had been in danger of becom simpli a system of sacrific and templ observ the onli prescrib act of worship consist of come to jerusalem everi so often and offer a sacrific dure the captiv with the templ gone the jew invent the synagogu a place of meet for read and studi and discuss of the scriptur thei came to realiz clearli what thei were in danger of forget while thei continu to live in judea that god is not simpli a local or tribal deiti not just the control of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish peopl but the creator of the world and the ruler and judg of all human everywher time pass and the babylonian empir wa replac by that of the persian and then that of the greek or rather the macedonian the ruler antiochu epiphan wa determin to stamp out judaism and to thi end he made the read and the studi of the torah punish by death again on might think that thi would be the end of judaism but it wa not the peopl met for worship and instead of read the torah portion appoint for the dai thei would read some passag from the prophet that had a similar theme and then discuss that befor thi time the torah the so call five book of mose genesi exodu leviticu number and deuteronomi were the onli book read and studi in the synagogu if it had not been for antiochu the book of the prophet would probabl have been forgotten altogeth hi hatr for judaism save them other exampl here omit for breviti s sake some of you mai rememb that juli andrew first becam famou as eliza doolittl in the stage product of my fair ladi when warner brother undertook to make a movi of it everyon expect that juli who had been so magnific on stage would plai the same role in the movi instead the studio decid to go with an establish screen star and cast audrei hepburn juli andrew wa natur crush but she later realiz that if she had plai the screen role she would have been type cast for life as an eliz doolittl type it would have been a disast for her as it wa walt disnei offer her the role of mari poppin and she won an oscar for it at the present she stood there smile and look at walt disnei she said and now my special thank to the man who made all thi possibl jack warner it wa the most memor line of the even in a similar spirit we jew might thank the men who in the provid of god have preserv judaism and kept it aliv to thi dai begin with joseph s brother and continu with two pharaoh with nebuchadnezzar with antiochu epiphan after the formal meet had broken up on woman came up to him privat and said you were talk about the holocaust weren t you he answer if that is an exampl that came to your mind then you ar right i wa talk about it to you but i would not talk about it to everyon for not everyon can bear it i assum that he meant that without the holocaust there would have been no state of israel someon hear the rabbi s lectur might leap to the conclus that god is depend on the wicked of men to accomplish hi purpos or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then go on to suppos that the wicked is in fact god s do that he stir up joseph s brother to a murder hate against him and that when the israelit were in egypt god harden pharaoh s heart so that he oppress the peopl and would not let them go and thi rais question about how an action can be consid wick and at the same time be consid someth that god ha brought about i suggest anoth wai of look at it consid a sculptor who ha a log of wood from which he propos to carv a statu but the log instead of have a smooth even grain throughout ha a larg knot that spoil the appear of the surfac the sculptor consid the wood for a while and then carv a statu that featur the knot that make that particular interrupt in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some featur of the statu so that observ will sai how fortun the sculptor wa in find a piec of wood with a knot like that in just the right place it presenc is the crown touch the thing that make the statu a great work of art in realiti the knot far from be what the sculptor wa look for wa a challeng to hi skill if the wood had not contain that flaw he would still have made a great work of art but a differ on so if joseph s brother had not sold him god would still have brought about hi purpos for the jewish peopl but he would have done so in anoth manner if juda had not betrai jesu if caiapha and hi fellow leader had not reject jesu but had rather acknowledg him as the annoint of god if pilat had follow hi conscienc rather than hi fear and had set jesu free it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion and therefor no redempt and therefor no salvat not so god did not need juda sin to redeem us if juda had done right then god in christ would still have reconcil the world to himself we do not know how just as we do not know how michelangelo would have paint the sistin chapel if it interior had instead been shape like grand central station and just as we do not know how bobbi fisher would have won hi fourth game agianst spasski if spasski had refus the exchang of bishop and had attack fisher s knight instead don t bother to look up the game in question i am make up thi exampl but the point is none the less valid thu we mai sai both that god us sai the cowardic of pilat to accomplish hi purpos and that the said cowardic wa not god s do and that pilat would not have thwart god s plan by behav justli and courag what then ar we to make of the place where god sai to mose i will harden pharaoh s heart so that he will not let the peopl go some christian have taken thi to mean that pharaoh wa a puppet with god pull the string and that hi stubborn and cruelti were not hi own work but the work of god in him i suppos rather that what god wa tell mose wa someth like thi if you see that pharaoh is not will to let the peopl go do not be discourag or suppos that the situat is out of my control my purpos will not be thwart if pharaoh choos to hear you and let the peopl go well and good if he doe not i will fit hi resist into my plan and fit it so perfectli that futur historian and theologian will suppos that i would have been thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obei me to return to the question that start thi all off is it possibl that the serb in slaughter the moslem of bosnia ar instrument of god s will first point what thei ar do is wrong just as what joseph s brother did wa wrong just as what juda did wa wrong thei intend it for evil if god somehow bring good out of it that doe not make them ani less subject to just condemn and punish second point of cours god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbian had refrain from the sin of robberi and rape and murder nor doe the good he purpos excus us from the duti of do what is right your jame kiefer
