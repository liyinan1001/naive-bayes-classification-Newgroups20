subject re serbian genocid work of god in articl mai atho rutger edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler write doe he believ in predestin of cours i believ in predestin it s a veri biblic doctrin as roman show among other passag furthermor the church ha alwai taught predestin from the veri begin realli you mai be right but i d like proof as far as i know and i am not a div school student the cathol church doe not seem to accept predestin my chaplain told me bewar of greek bear gift with refer to thi doctrin it seem to have the curiou result that human be ar not held respons for their own action i ll answer how you deal with thi in a minut but to sai that i believ in predestin doe not mean i do not believ in free will men freeli choos the cours of their life which is also affect by the grace of god howev unlik the calvinist and jansenist i hold that grace is resist otherwis you end up with the idioci of deni the univers save will of god timothi right that doesn t realli seem like predestin to me but i ll continu with what you re sai for god must give enough grace to all to be save but onli the elect who he foreknew ar predestin and receiv the grace of final perserver which guarante heaven thi doe not mean that those without that grace can t be save it just mean that god foreknew their obstinaci and chose not to give it to them know thei would not need it as thei had freeli chosen hell thi is realli confus to me especi sinc i still believ that christ jesu di for all of us preknowledg of obstinaci seem like an awfulli convolut wai to account for a coupl of vers but then i am not realli biblic support in thi opinion or am i other peopl who ar save ar save by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it wa god who dispos them to himself and predestin them to becom saint but those who perish in everlast fire perish becaus thei harden their heart and chose to perish thu thei were deserv of god s punish as thei had reject their creator and sin against the work of the holi spirit so god us grace like margarin he onli spread it where it s need and not where it isn t and so there ar the save and the not save and noth in between hmmmm ye it is up to god to judg but he will onli mete out that punish at the last judgement well i would hold that as god most certainli give everybodi some bless for what good thei have done even if it wa onli a littl for those he can t bless in the next life he bless in thi on although i realiz thi doctrin wa not origin intend to caus social problem it end up do just that if there is suppos to be some sort of sign that someon is elect like lot of children or success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go around think that those who don t ar doom to hell in a wai though thi sound like the opposit idea those doom to hell will have a great life on earth that s almost like the convers of what i believ respons for what we do now will be punish after we die you re sai what we get after we die ha a direct bear on how we live now strang and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastis in thi on or in purgatori for their sin everi sin incur some tempor punish thu god will punish it unless satisfact is made for it cf samuel david s sin of adulteri and murder were forgiven but he wa still punish with the death of hi child and i need not point out the idea of punish becaus of god s judgement is quit prevel in the bibl sodom and gommorrah mose bar from the holi land the slaughter of the cannanit annia and saphira jerusalem in ad etc so sin is either punish now or later and not both what if it s sort of half punish ar there ani grei area in thi doctrin my stuff delet we should stop the slaughter of the innoc cf proverb but doe that mean that christian should support a war in bosnia with the u s or even the u n involv i do not think so but i am an isolationist and disagre with foreign adventur in gener but in the case of bosnia i frankli see no excus for us get militarili involv it would not be a just war bless after all ar the peacemak wa what our lord said not the interventionist our action in bosnia must be for peac and not for a war which is unrel to anyth to justifi it for us the idea well my idea would be that you would interven to establish peac and stop the atroc i m not suggest wwiii i don t realli understand what you mean by a just war of cours i am not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jump in at the first opportun can you sai kuwait we happen to be a big countri with a lot of resourc as well as a lot of debt and thi give us some respons in the world whether we like it or not flashback of wwii as well as vietnam should be haunt us yet anoth differ of opinion so be it andi byler thank you for answer i hope you don t take ani of my comment as flame but instead as express of interest vera i am your clock i bind unto myself todai vera noy i am your religion the strong name of the noy midwai uchicago edu i own you
