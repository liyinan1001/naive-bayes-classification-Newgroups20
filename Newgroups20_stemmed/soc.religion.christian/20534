subject re reason vs revel in articl apr atho rutger edu trajan stephen mcintyr write in articl apr atho rutger edu write i can onli repli with what it sai in timothi i m not here to discount part of the bibl rather i m here onli to discount the notion of revel the author of timothi told what he thought wa the truth base on hi belief in god hi faith in jesu as the resurrect son and hi read of the old testament but again what had been reveal to him wa base on at best second hand inform given by friend and author who mai not have given the whole truth or who mai have exagger a bit first of all the origin poster misquot the refer is from tim the author wa paul and hi revel were anyth but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journei he wa approach damascu and suddenli a light from heaven flash around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voic sai to him saul saul why ar you persecut me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesu whom you ar persecut act na paul receiv revel directli from the risen jesu pretti cool eh he becam close involv with the earli church the leader of which were follow of jesu throughout hi ministri on earth now you mai sai the holi spirit reveal these thing unto him and we could go into that argument but you d be hard press to convinc me that the holi spirit exist i agre i don t believ anyon but the spirit would be abl to convinc you the spirit exist pleas don t complain about thi be circular i know it is but realli can anyth of the natur world explain the supernatur thi is why revel is necessari to the author of the bibl addition what he ha written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carri the chanc it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the sourc can you get the greek in timothi which is sometim translat as inspir by god liter mean god breath in other word god spoke the actual word into the scriptur mani theologian and bibl scholar dr jame boic is on that i can rememb off hand get quit annoi by the dryness and incomplet of inspir by god the onli wai you would be abl to escap thi notion of second hand info is to have had the entir bibl written by god himself and to tell the truth i ve studi the bibl extens and have yet to hear of scholar who have put forth object evid show god as the first author of thi collect of book that s what the vers taken from timothi wa all about the continu of a book written over a span of year by more than author from all walk of life is a testimoni to the singl authorship of god and as for reason read what it sai in corinthian about human wisdom basic it sai that human wisdom is useless when compar with what god ha written for our learn if you knew of jesu as well as you know the bibl you d realiz he reason out the law and the prophet for the common man what sourc to you claim to have discov which ha inform of superior histor to the bibl certainli not josephu write or the write of the gnostic which were third centuri at the earliest and though some claim jesu wa he wa human with all of the human wisdom the apostl paul set out to critic yet would you not embrac the idea that jesu wa wise jesu wa fulli god as well that s why i d assert that he is wise i realis that you mai not accept the author of the bibl thi is unfortun to sai the least becaus there is no other wai of learn about god and christ and god s purpos with the earth than read the bibl and search out it truth for yourself for your inform i wa rais without ani knowledg of god by the time some of the faith came to show me the word and share with me it truth i wa live happili and moral without acknowledg the exist of a suprem be i have though read the bibl sever time over in it entireti and have studi it thoroughli it contain truth in it and i consid jesu to be on of the most moral of human be to have live in fact i darn near idol the gui but there s no ration reason for me to except god s exist pleas rethink thi last paragraph if there is no god which seem to be your current belief then jesu wa either a liar or a complet nut becaus not onli did he assert that god exist but he claim to be god himself regard to c s lewi how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesu in conclus be care about logic unfound hypothes base on gut feel about the text and other scholar unsubstanti claim the bibl plead that we take it in it entireti or throw the whole book out about your read of the bibl not onli doe the spirit inspir the writer but he guid the reader as well we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit s guidanc for to us god reveal them through the spirit for the spirit search all thing even the depth of god cor na peac and mai god guid us in wisdom carter c page of happi the crown and chiefest part is wisdom a carpent s apprentic and to hold god in aw thi is the law that cpage sea upenn edu see the stricken heart of pride brought down we learn when we ar old adapt from sophocl other theologian get quit annoi at the misleadingess of god breath it s true that the greek word ha as it root god and breath howev etymolog doesn t necessarili tell you what a word mean otherwis goodby would be a religi express sinc it come from god be with ye you have to look at how the word wa actual us in thi case the word is us for wisdom or dream that come from god but god breath is an
