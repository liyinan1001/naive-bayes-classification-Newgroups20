or mai not agre to the bound of those categori howev and the veri fact that thei ar argu over suggest that not onli is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excel rhetorician had no interest in make them clear leav matter rather to our spirit led decis with all the uncomfort live with other read that ha domin christian discuss of all these area what is fornic sex outsid of marriag abus of sex is not homosexu intercours outsid the context of marriag isn t it an unatur us of what god ha given us why is it that homosexu ar us the grace of god as a licens to practic sin for certain person have crept in unnot those who were long beforehand mark out for thi condemn ungodli person who turn the grace of our god into licenti and deni our onli master and lord jesu christ jude nasb what is

hi wife and likewis also the wife to her husband corinthian nasb there ar plenti of law prohibit sexual behavior to be found in leviticu most of which christian ignor complet thei never even bother to examin them thei just assum that thei know which on ar moral and which on ar ritual well i have new for you ani anthropolog cours should sensit you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categori in an aw lot of societi we have them too but buri pretti deep and i cannot see ani ground for distinguish these bit of leviticu from the ritual law which no christian i know feel appli to us i disagre everi law that is written in leviticu should be look at as sin that is why we have a need for a savior i can understand someon who mai not know a particular sin list in the levitc law but i would hope that thei would repent when confront with it i notic that the vers forbid bestial immedi follow the vers prohibit what appear to be homosexu intercours well la ti da so what thi is almost as slimei an argument as the on that homosexu rape i know of no on who argu serious though on can alwai find joker in defens of bestial it is absolut irrelev and incompar to the issu gai christian do rais which concern sexual activ within commit consensu human adult realtionship so that your bring it up is no more relev than the law of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issu you ar be bloodi dishonest in trail thi red her in front of the world if you want to address bestial that is your busi not mine and attempt to torpedo a seriou issu by us what is in our cultur a ridicul joke show that you have no interest in hear us as human be you want to dismiss us and us the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so also i notic that the preceed vers sai also you shall not approach a woman to uncov her naked dure her menstrual impur and you shall not have intercours with your neighbor wife to be defil with her leviticu nasb these vers ar just as relev as you shall not lie with a male as on li with a femal it is an abomin leviticu nasb why wa god tell the israelit not to practic such thing do not defil yourselv by ani of these thing for by all these the nation which i am cast out befor you have becom defil for the land ha becom defil therefor i have visit it punish upon it so the land ha spew out it inhabit but as for you you ar to keep my statut and judgment and shall not do ani of these abomin neither the nativ nor the alien who sojourn among you leviticu nasb he is the lord listen to what he ha to sai nobodi want to dismiss homosexu we do love you but we don t agre that what you practic is not sin you have not truli repent of your sin we hate the sin that is within your live i hate sin that is in my life all christian should hate the sin that is within their own live confrontaion with sin should bring about repent ye i agre with john but i also know that jesu said repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt if you don t agre that homosexu is sin than how can
