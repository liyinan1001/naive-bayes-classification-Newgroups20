subject re accept jeesu in your heart disclaim throughout thi post there ar statement and question which could easili be interpret as be sarcast thei ar not i have written thi repli in the most even hand manner that i can with no emot boil to the surfac as it wa written pleas accept thi as a seriou attempt to foster dialog and rest assur that i make everi attempt to make fun of no on except myself gsu uxa ecn bgu edu eric mola write firstli i am an atheist i am not post here as an immatur flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intend audienc the human be is an anim who ha due to hi her advanc mental facil develop religi as a satisfi solut to explain the unexplain hmmm there ar other anim on thi planet with advanc mental facil which have not develop religion as a satisfactori explain for the unexplain why is thi so further it appear that onli human have a need to explain the unexplain why is thi so the other anim on thi planet includ those with advanc mental facil seem perfectli content in their ignor i d like to point out that your presupposit scream out at me from your unsupport statement thei ar human ar anim onli religion exist as a crutch so that the unexplain need not be research religion wa made up by human to address a perceiv need the biolog aspect of human is deifi that is all aspect of human life can be categor in a hierarch structur with biologi at the apex needless to sai i disagre with your strong opinion and the underli presupposit christian is an infecti cult the reason it flourish ar becaus it give peopl without hope or driven purpos in life a safeti blank to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow thi christian moral standard and i get etern happi for all of you found jeezu how mani of you were on the brink i disagre that christian is an infecti cult it ha certainli shown itself to be persist as a belief system in spite of variou persecut throughout the past two millenia that it continu to persever doe not demonstr that it is infecti in a derrogatori sens it mai be that it provid a workabl system for it adher and i would argu that thi is the case i disagre that christian is a safeti blanket which supplant hope and purpos rather it point an individu to the on sourc of hope and purpos there is noth hidden about a christian s sourc for hope and purpos of what us to you is the distinct between intern motiv hope and purpos and extern given hope and purpos is the appar loss of control over on s own life the problem or is it someth els final on doe not appropri etern happi by follow christian moral standard inde the sole reason for the exist of christian is becaus standard ar inadequ to save peopl from their imperfect moral standard ar mere guid to the christian the real power to moral live is given to the christian in the person of god s spirit heaven is on of two final state that christian doctrin postul howev christian ar gener not motiv to live accord to christian moral standard by thi promis futur reward rather thei ar motiv by the perceiv benefit to them in the here and now but i digress the other reason christian flourish is it infecti natur a best friend of mine breifli enter a christian group and within month thei set ministri guidelin for him which basicali said thi prioriti spread the word mani christian organ ar concern with evangel as a prioriti and rightli so for it wa jesu himself who gave thi as a prioriti for hi follow howev it is not the penultim prioriti as evangel is normal understood i e preach the word convert at nearli ani cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangel is gener best done through respect the opinion of other while demonstr the veri real benefit of a christian lifestyl thi demonstr should be so power that it compel the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to sai such a demonstr is not easili accom plish it take a radic committ to the person of jesu it doe not happen quickli so persever on the part of the christian is requir and it cannot occur where no person bond of friendship exist it is ineffect with stranger who cannot evalu the demonstr over time and it is easi to alien or harm other if the sole purpos of be a friend is to gain a convers as a long time christian nearli year i view with some skep ticism all evangel program which incorpor a hurri up attitud pressur convers mai ultim be wors than no convers at all becaus the pressur convert realiz s he wa coerc and disavow christian when thei would have been open to it in the futur had thei not been taken advantag of now the bibl state that it is the veri spirit of god which bring convict of wrong do to peopl i am content to do my part wit and let the spirit do the rest we ar just anim we need sleep food and we reproduc and we die we ar far more than anim we sleep eat reproduc and die just as other anim do true but we ar also capabl of more than thi if your person vision of human or of yourself is so limit i can onli hope and prai that you will somedai find a more expans view for reflect what anim have the wide varieti of perform art that human do how is it that human can learn the languag of other human or anim but that other anim cannot do so how is it that human can organ themselv in variou social structur wherea other anim have onli on structur religion especi christian is noth more than a drug blatant assert christian is not physic addict christian is not psycholog addict christian is not a thing which on snort ingest shoot up it is a relationship with a live be you might as validli character ani close knit relationship with thi appel some peopl us drug as an escap from realiti christian inject themselv with jeezu and live with that high there ar jesu freak who let the emot aspect of worship and christian live gain and retain the upper hand even so thi doe not by itself invalid the foundat from which these thing flow it piti me how mani million of live have been lost in religi war of which christian ha had no small part guilti by associ that christian which forc itself upon anoth is not christian at all when christian see a non believ thei sai that person is blind to the truth but thei cannot realiz that it is thei who live with thi mask of fake each dai jesu wa just prophet who happen to have a larg influenc becaus at that time the roman were circa ad dispers the jewish popul and commun need some sort of cohes element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amaz certainti about what realli happen year ago how did you come by it i cannot accept your conclus that jesu influenc wa a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he wa year gone by thi time it strain the bound of credul to assert that noth about jesu life wa noteworthi until the sack i must go these ar but a few of my thought on christian christian is have a relationship with jesu christ himself what do you know of him we read the world wrong
