subject mari and idol i have been studi the bibl now for about a year i love it but i am not veri familiar with the differ denomin or tradit or common belief of variou christian group i have heard variou peopl outsid thi new group describ idol such as power monei materi possess etc these thing ar worship in some sens i suppos but i never realli gave idol much thought until now i have been read the post in thi new group which i just found a few dai ago and i have a question first i m not try to question anyon s belief or try to push my view on anyon els i haven t been at thi long enough to have ani view other than i cannot get to heaven by be good i must understand that christ bore my sin on the cross so that i could be save and i need to repent i e realiz that everi time i sin i might as well stick a sharp stick in christ s side becaus he took the punish for my sin when he di on the cross in my studi mari never realli come up i know who she is but that s about it it seem to me that a statu of mari could be consid an idol do peopl prai to statu of mari it sound like educ christian more educ than myself i m sure believ mari wa sinless wow i hope to spend the summer convinc myself on wai or the other about tongu i m read charismat chao i guess i ll studi tongu in parallel with read thi new group ani help you can give me will be appreci i don t think the issu is so much that peopl ar more educ than you though it mai well be that thei ar as that thei come from a differ tradit than your thi is a discuss between cathol and protest cathol gener believ that mari wa sinless protest do not the issu come down to differ sourc of author protest gener limit themselv to the bibl as a sourc of doctrin sinc thi isn t in the bibl except in passag that no on would understand in thi wai if thei didn t alreadi believ it protest don t accept it cathol see continu revel through the church though thei believ the result ar consist with the bibl i interpret your post not as a call for yet anoth argument about whether the cathol marian devot ar idolatri an argument i am not prepar to see new here but as a sign of be interest in learn about tradit other than your own cathol ar of cours a major on but by no mean the onli on i gener consid the major tradit to be cathol orthodox and variou subset of protestant within protestant it s a matter of how fine you want to cut thing these dai i think the major divis is between those who accept biblic inerr and those who don t there ar also a number of major histor tradit but in recent decad distinct ar tend to blur i d identifi the major protest tradit as lutheran reform anglican thei re sort of halfwai between cathol and protest wesleyan baptist holi pentecost church of christ but there ar a number of other histor distinct tend not to be so import among the liber church anymor and i think current trend in societi and the church ar also tend to make conserv seen themselv as alli from a gener evangel perspect but differ among these variou tradit ar still quit mark i think the best introduct to these issu is to read a good book on church histori anyon who want to understand the church realli need to understand how we got where we ar now a church histori will normal show you where each of these tradit came from and give a feel for their natur unfortun i m awai from my librari at the moment so i don t have anyth specif to recommend clh
