subject re arsenokoitai nt mean of convict of sin a meta exeget or methodolog essai in articl mai atho rutger edu rexlex fnal fnal gov write i can t post it all at onc so it will come piec meal and not daili i look forward to read it when i got to the librari last week it wa with the object in view to look at some articl that have appear over the last few year sinc my previou look at the literatur un fortun thei had move the journal back issu so i didn t get a look at the articl i wa hope to find i will continu to reserv my own judgment on arsenokoitai until i have seen the latest scholarli work and i can hope that rexlex s post mai give some meat to chew on howev what i can do now is to point out the methodolog issu what need to be shown for anyth to be conclud in thi matter if the articl rexlex post address these issu so much the better if not you will perhap understand why the problem is hard jame b deyoung write in abstractu thi studi argu that paul coin the term arsenokoitai deriv it from the lxx of lev cf and us it for homosexu orient and behavior it is onli a minor point but let me make it anywai de young ha alreadi contradict hi own prior assert in thi abstract that the ancient analysi of these issu wa concern with action and not with orient i doubt thi will have much bear on the articl as such but thought i should point it out from the start the hypothesi de young is advanc is that paul a coin the word and b hi intend mean for it wa in refer to the levit law the question i wish to rais ar how would on go about confirm the truth of thi hypothesi and what follow if on accept or stipul for the sake of the discuss that it is correct note that b is independ of a i consid b far more plausibl than a which seem mere to be a counsel of despair over find noth in the literatur contemporari with paul to clarifi thi word so far as i know paul doe not in gener invent word anywher els in hi letter unless you have an otherwis establish pattern of coinag it is not sound methodolog to assum it particularli if he give no hint in the immedi at text to fix the coinag s mean for hi audienc as yet the extract present no evid at all what do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesi which i should sai at the outset i find somewhat plausibl i certainli know of noth which make it an imposs wai of constru thi problem passag i m go to set asid for the moment the question of whether paul might have coin thi usag to look at the more tractabl question of what it mean for thi there ar in principl two kind of evid that can be adduc intern and extern that is we can look at the text of paul s letter for clarif or look outsid that to prior or contemporari write that paul might have reli on or to deriv write that have some claim of access to paul s mean the singl worst problem with thi word in corinthian is that there is no intern evid for paul s mean he us the word total without an explan or hint as to hi mean save that it inclus in a list of neg impli that it ha for him some neg mean we ar left as the onli intern clue with the etymolog or format of the word which is inde the reason that de young and other befor him have associ it with the leviticu prohibit of men verb with other men where verb is some standard euphem for have sex lie in leviticu bed in greek on problem is that bedder koitai is not as far as i know us that wai in greek therefor i offer on seriou test which de young s hypothesi must pass or be reject o find a bodi of greek text contemporari with paul or not much prior to hi dai such that the x koitai format impli men who have sex with x obvious the best case is to find such usag of arsenokoitai itself such text would be confirm that the word can be read that wai it is worth emphas that compound word ar not in gener under standabl by project what the reader mai imagin by the juxtaposit of the root exist of such parallel doesn t prove the hypothesi correct but it goe a long wai toward make such a usag whether or not origin with paul in the specif case of x ars n possibl of comprehens by hi reader my test move in the direct of extern evid if paul doe not in hi text explain hi word and he doe not then he ha to expect hi reader to alreadi know the word which stand against it be a coinag or to expect that it mimic word format that thei do know such that thei can guess hi mean without too much flounder extern evid that is text other than paul s own and lexicograph or social histor consider that might be adduc then come into the pictur if there ar other us of the word not depend on paul which have suffici intern contextu evid or some gloss by a contemporari scribe to show a derogatori refer to male homosexu aliti or similar koitai format us in similar wai then on ha ground for o deni that paul coin the word and o assum that hi reader might understand hi mean do you see the problem if paul coin the word then he requir hi reader to share enough context with him to comprehend hi coinag and it intent in thi case that thei would stipul de young s guess understand him to be refer to the levit univers prohibit of male male sex thi mind you in a context where paul ha emphas at least to other congreg and so on assum to the corinthian how els to explain cor and the corinthian have to be pull back from overinterpret their freedom the non applic of torah law to hi gentil convert among the consider that make it implaus for paul to have coin the word it first element is archaic ars n is an old attic or ionic form of what in even classic let alon koin time would be assimil as arr n to me thi impli that we ar even more than usual need of extern evid to pin down mean and usag what is paul do invent a word in obsolet attic format and if he didn t coin the word but pick it up like the other in hi list as common term of derog then hi mean will be for hi reader constrain by that common mean sinc he give no other i cannot emphas enough that paul doe not tell us what he mean by thi word we and hi origin reader ar guess thei at least had a contemporari context and mayb paul had us thi veri word and explain it in great detail to them in person but we have no trace of evid of that and to suppos it is mere fantasi so we ar desper in need of extern evid about thi word and it seem to be exception meagr that is precis the problem i can think of sever more or less equal plausibl hypothes about the word a it wa a standard gutter term of abus for some or all mayb veri specif mayb veri gener homosexu male activ b it wa a term of abus us by jew about the aw homosexu greek which mai or mai not be conscious associ on their part with the leviticu passag c paul invent the term and again there mai or mai not be an associ with leviticu in hi do so he mai or mai not intend the word to have an explicit and univers applic with absolut and clear boundari sinc none of hi other word in that list have such charact thi last seem to me about the least plausibl of the hypothes i m advanc of these i d sai off the top of my head that a is most plausibl but i still have reserv about that too if the word never appear befor paul and in later us ha some evid of depend on paul then on can opt for paul s coin it if it doe appear befor him he might still have coin it be unawar of prior us in which case hi coinag is inher confus but on should normal demot c on the basi of ani earlier us especi if thei can be shown to have been at all common in the place paul travel in either of the a or b case on ha to take into account paul s relat to the commun of usag he pick the word up from and whether it be from the greek or jewish commun paul s relat ar hardli straight forward there is so far as i have yet seen littl or no extern evid to aid us in select on of these or some other hypothesi your guess is as good as mine or mayb wors or mayb better depend on a lot of thing but it remain so far guesswork and i don t know about you but i for on will not equat human guesswork with the will of god by all mean be convinc in your own conscienc about what paul is get at as he sai elsewher on what wa in hi dai a major controversi of somewhat thi same charact roman hold on to your own belief as between yourself and god and consid the man fortun who can make hi decis without go against hi conscienc but anybodi who eat in a state of doubt is condemn becaus he is not in good faith and everi act done in bad faith is a sin for my part i cannot see ani wai to resolv paul s mean in the us of arsenokoitai without directli applic extern evid and by the natur of such extern evid it will never reach to certainti of constrain paul s own intent paul like humpti dumpti and me and all the rest of us will us word in wai that ar person choic and sometim leav hi reader puzzl if that puzzlement lead you to god it mai be bless if it should lead awai as some of paul s word have led some peopl then paul s intens commun effort to contriv hi mean in our soul mai have some regret consequ i have alwai found paul to be a fantast reliabl guid if i read him in the larg if i can see him lai out hi posit in detail and hammer it home time and time again i am much less certain about hi mean in hi mani brief and cryptic passag such as thi on in my usual discurs wai i have gone on at great length about the first of my intend meta exeget point what would be need to confirm that paul a coin or b in ani case meant the word to mean the same as the leviticu prohibit my second point is to stipul thi hypo thesi and follow up what it impli for both hi initi reader
