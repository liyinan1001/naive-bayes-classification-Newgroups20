subject re monophysit and mike walker in articl mai geneva rutger edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler write mike walker if you ar us the standard formula of fulli god and fulli human that i m not sure why you object to sai that jesu wa human i think the usual analysi would be that sin is not part of the basic definit of human it s a consequ of the fall jesu is human but not a fallen human clh i differ with our moder on thi i thought the whole idea of god come down to earth to live as on of us subject to sin and death as on of the consecr prayer in the book of common prayer put it wa that jesu wa tempt but did not succumb if sin is not part of the basic definit of human then jesu fulli human nicea would not be subject to sin but then the resurrect lose some of it mean becaus we encount our human most powerfulli when we sin to distinguish between human and fallen human make jesu less like on of us at the time we need him most these issu get mighti subtl when you see peopl sai differ thing it s often hard to tell whether thei realli mean serious differ thing or whether thei ar us differ terminolog i don t think there s ani question that there is a problem with nestoriu and i would agre that the sai christ had a human form without a real human natur or will is heret but i d like to be a bit wari about the copt armenian etc recent discuss suggest that their monophysit posit mai not be as far from orthodoxi as mani had thought nestoriu wa an extrem repres of on of the two major school of thought more moder repres were regard as orthodox e g theodor of mopsuestia my impress is that the modern monophysit group inherit the entir tradit not just nestoriu version and that some of them mai have a suffici balanc posit to be regard as orthodox clh first the monophysit inherit none of nestoriu s version thei were on the opposit end of the spectrum from him second the histor record suggest that the posit attribut to nestoriu were not as extrem as hi success oppon who wrote the convent histori claim mainli nestoriu oppos the term theotoko for mari argu i think correctli that a human could not be call mother of god i mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreat sure even arian would conced that jesu exist long befor mari anywai nestoriu s oppon claim that by sai mari wa not theotoko that he claim that she onli gave birth to the human natur of jesu which would requir two seper and distinct natur the argument fail though becaus mari simpli gave birth to jesu who preexist her either divin if you accept nestorian as commonli defin or both natur intertwin a la chalcedon second i am not sure that nestorian is not a better altern than the orthodox view after all i find it hard to believ that pre incarn that jesu s human natur wa in heaven likewis post ascens i think rather that god came to earth and took our natur upon him it wa a seper natur capabl of be tempt as in gethseman sinc i believ the divin natur could never be tempt but in it moment of weak the divin natur prevail comment on the abov warmli appreci jason albert there mai be differ in what we mean by subject to sin the origin complaint wa from someon who didn t see how we could call jesu fulli human becaus he didn t sin i complet agre that jesu wa subject to temptat i simpli object to the idea that by not succumb he is therebi not fulli human i believ that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apolog for confus nestorian and monophysit i agre with you and have said elsewher that there s reason to think that not everyon who is associ with heret posit wa in fact heret there ar scholar who maintain that nestoriu wa not nestorian i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspond between nestoriu and hi oppon i thought he got the better of them howev most scholar do believ that the work that eventu led to chalcedon wa an advanc and that nestoriu wa at the veri least rash and dogmat as the editor of the christolog controversi refer to him in reject all approach other than hi own as regular usenet reader know narrow can be just as much an impedi as be wrong furthermor he did sai some thing that i think ar problemat he respond to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthi of usenet in it he sai to attribut also to the logo in the name of the incarn the characterist of the flesh that ha been conjoin with him is my brother either the work of a mind which truli err in the fashion of the greek or that of a mind diseas with the insan heresi of ariu and apollinari and the other those who ar thu carri awai with the idea of thi associ ar bound becaus of it to make the divin logo have a part in be fed with milk and particip to some degre in growh and stand in need of angel assist becaus of hi fear these thing ar taken fals when thei ar put off on the deiti and thei becom the occas of just condemn for us who perpetr the falsehood it s all well and good to maintain a proper distinct between human and divin but the whole concept of incarn is base on exactli the idea that the divin logo doe in fact have to some degre a part in be born grow up and dy of cours it must be understood that there s a certain indirect in the logo particip in these thing but there must be some sort of identif between the divin and human or we don t have an incarn at all nestoriu seem to think in black and white term and miss the sort of nuanc on need to deal with thi area you sai i find it hard to believ that pre incarn that jesu s human natur wa in heaven i don t think that s requir by orthodox doctrin it s the divin logo that is etern clh
