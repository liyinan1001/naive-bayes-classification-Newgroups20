subject re monophysit and mike walker hello src reader again the misconcept that copt among other orient orthodox church believ in monophysit pop up again we had a discuss about it a while ago in articl mai geneva rutger edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler write the proper term for what mike express is monophysit thi wa a heresi that wa condemn in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorian which held that the son and jesu ar two differ peopl who happen to be unit in the same bodi temporarili monophysit is held by the copt of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobit of syria and the armenian orthodox then ofm comment these issu get mighti subtl when you see peopl sai differ thing it s often hard to tell whether thei realli mean serious differ thing or whether thei ar us differ terminolog i don t think there s ani question that there is a problem with nestoriu and i would agre that the sai christ had a human form without a real human natur or will is heret but i d like to be a bit wari about the copt armenian etc recent discuss suggest that their monophysit posit mai not be as far from orthodoxi as mani had thought with my appreci to the moder i believ that further elabor is need thi is an excerpt from an articl featur in the first issu of the copt net newslett under the author of the eastern roman empir of constantinopl as oppos to the western empir of rome the patriarch and pope of alexandria plai lead role in christian theologi thei were invit everywher to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria wa the head of the ecumen council which wa held in ephesu in the year a d it wa said that the bishop of the church of alexandria did noth but spend all their time in meet thi lead role howev did not fare well when polit start to intermingl with church affair it all start when the emperor marcianu interf with matter of faith in the church the respons of st dioscoru the pope of alexandria who wa later exil to thi interfer wa clear you have noth to do with the church these polit motiv becam even more appar in chalcedon in when the coptic church wa unfairli accus of follow the teach of eutych who believ in monophysit thi doctrin maintain that the lord jesu christ ha onli on natur the divin not two natur the human as well as the divin the coptic church ha never believ in monophysit the wai it wa portrai in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysit meant believ in on natur copt believ that the lord is perfect in hi divin and he is perfect in hi human but hi divin and hi human were unit in on natur call the natur of the incarn word which wa reiter by st cyril of alexandria copt thu believ in two natur human and divin that ar unit in on without mingl without confus and without alter from the declar of faith at the end of the coptic divin liturgi these two natur did not separ for a moment or the twinkl of an ey also from the declar of faith at the end of the coptic divin liturgi the coptic church wa misunderstood in the th centuri at the council of chalcedon perhap the council understood the church correctli but thei want to exil the church to isol it and to abolish the egyptian independ pope despit all of thi the coptic church ha remain veri strict and steadfast in it faith whether it wa a conspiraci from the western church to exil the coptic church as a punish for it refus to be polit influenc or whether pope dioscuru didn t quit go the extra mile to make the point that copt ar not monophysit the coptic church ha alwai felt a mandat to reconcil semant differ between all christian church thi is aptli express by the current th successor of st mark pope shenouda iii to the coptic church faith is more import than anyth and other must know that semant and terminolog ar of littl import to us throughout thi centuri the coptic church ha plai an import role in the ecumen movement the coptic church is on of the founder of the world council of church it ha remain a member of that council sinc a d the coptic church is a member of the all african council of church aacc and the middl east council of church mecc the church plai an import role in the christian movement by conduct dialogu aim at resolv the theolog differ with the cathol greek orthodox presbyterian and evangel church as a final note the orient orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a common statement of christolog in which the heresei of monophysit wa condemn so the coptic orthodox church doe not believ in monophysit peac nabil nabil ayoub engin research center dept of mechan engin univers of wisconsin madison email ayoub erctitan me wisc edu as i mention in a brief apolog the comment quot abov from me is confus i appear to sai that nestoriu wa monophysit as andrew byler correctli state it the nestorian and monophysit were actual opposit parti the point i wa make which nabil explain in some detail is that some group that have been consid heret probabl aren t chalcedon wa a compromis between two group the alexandrian and antiochen it adopt languag that wa intend to be accept to moder in both camp while rule out the extrem i agre that there were extrem that were heret howev in the cours of the complex polit of the time it appear that some peopl got reject who didn t intend heresi but simpli us languag that wa not understood or even wa mispres and some seem not to have joint in the compromis for reason other than doctrin there ar group descend from both of the supposedli heret camp thi post discuss the descend of the alexandrian there ar also a remain nestorian like some of the current so call monophysit there is reason to believ that the current so call nestorian ar not heret either thei shelter nestoriu from what thei saw as unfair treatment but claim thei did not adopt hi heresi and in fact seem to follow more moder repres of the antiochen tradit clh
