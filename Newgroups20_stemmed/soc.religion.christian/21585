subject re homosexu issu in christian in articl mai atho rutger edu mserv mozart cc iup edu someon name mark write ml panix com michael siemon write homosexu christian have inde check out these vers some of them ar us against us onli through incred pervers interpret other simpli do not address the issu i can see that some of the abov vers do not clearli address the issu there ar exactli zero vers that clearli address the issu howev a coupl of them seem as though thei do not requir incred pervers interpret in order to be seen as condemn homosexu the kind of interpret i see as incred pervers is that appli to the stori of sodom as if it were a blanket equat of homosexu behavior and rape sinc christian cite the bibl in such a context should be presum to have at least read the stori it amount to slander a charg that homosexu rape to us that against us do not be deceiv neither fornic nor idol nor adulter nor effemin nor homosexu nor thiev nor the covet nor drunkard nor revil nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor the moder adequ discuss the circular of your us of porneia in thi i think we can all agre with paul that there ar some kind of activ that could be name by fornic or theft or covet or revil or drunken which would well deserv condemn we mai or mai not agre to the bound of those categori howev and the veri fact that thei ar argu over suggest that not onli is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excel rhetorician had no interest in make them clear leav matter rather to our spirit led decis with all the uncomfort live with other read that ha domin christian discuss of all these area homosexu behavior is no differ i and the other gai christian i know ar adam in condemn rape heterosexu or homosexu and child molest heterosexu or homosexu and even the possibl harmless but obsess kind of sex heterosexu or homosexu that would stand condemn by paul in the veri continu of the chapter you cite mai i mildli suggest that what paul doe in hi letter that you want to us is perhap a good guid to hi mean i am free to do anyth you sai ye but not everyth is for my good no doubt i am free to do anyth but i for on will not let anyth make free with me cor which is a restat that we must have no other god befor god a command neither i nor ani other gai christian wish to break some peopl ar inde involv in obsess driven mode of sexual behavior it is just as wrong though slightli less incendiari so it s a secondari argument from the phobic conting to equat homosexu with such behavior as to equat it with the rape of god s messeng i won t deal with the exegesi of leviticu except veri tangenti fundament you ar exhibit the same circular here as in your assumpt that you know what porneia mean there ar plenti of law prohibit sexual behavior to be found in leviticu most of which christian ignor complet thei never even bother to examin them thei just assum that thei know which on ar moral and which on ar ritual well i have new for you ani anthropolog cours should sensit you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categori in an aw lot of societi we have them too but buri pretti deep and i cannot see ani ground for distinguish these bit of leviticu from the ritual law which no christian i know feel appli to us i m dead seriou here when peopl start go on as thei do in thi matter about how repuls and unnatur our act ar and what do thei know about it huh it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrari cultur inculc as the american prejudic against eat insect on what basi other than assum your conclus can you sai that the law against male male intercours in leviticu is not a part of the ritual law for those christian who do think that some part of leviticu can be law for christian while other ar not even to be thought about it is incumb on you in everi case handl on it own merit to determin why you pick on and ignor anoth i frankli think the whole effort misguid reread paul no doubt i am free to do anyth but christian have a criterion to us for make our judgment on thi the great command of love for god and neighbor if you cannot go through leviticu and decid each command there on that basi then your own arbitrari select from it is simpli idiosyncraci in thi context it is remark offens to sai i notic that the vers forbid bestial immedi follow the vers prohibit what appear to be homosexu intercours well la ti da so what thi is almost as slimei an argument as the on that homosexu rape i know of no on who argu serious though on can alwai find joker in defens of bestial it is absolut irrelev and incompar to the issu gai christian do rais which concern sexual activ within commit consensu human adult realtionship so that your bring it up is no more relev than the law of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issu you ar be bloodi dishonest in trail thi red her in front of the world if you want to address bestial that is your busi not mine and attempt to torpedo a seriou issu by us what is in our cultur a ridicul joke show that you have no interest in hear us as human be you want to dismiss us and us the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so jesu and paul both expound veri explictli and in consider length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we ar requir to love on anoth and all els depend on that gai and lesbian christ ian challeng you to address the issu on those term and all we get in return ar cheap debat trick attempt to side track the issu christian no doubt veri sincer on keep show up here and in everi corner of usenet and the world and all thei ever do is spout these same old vers which thei obvious have never thought about mayb never even read in total ignor of the issu rais slander us with the vilest charg of child abus or whatev their perfervid mind can manag to conjur up toss out red her with thei suppos great emot forc to caus reader to dismiss our wit without even take the troubl to find out what it is such behavior should shame anyon who claim to have seen truth in christ why for god s preciou sake do you peopl quot irrelev vers to condemn peopl you don t know and won t even take the troubl to listen to befor you start your condemn is that love your neighbor god forbid is that how you obei the repeat command to not judg or condemn other christ and paul spend order of magnitud more time in insist on thi than the half dozen obscur word in paul that you ar so bloodi readi to take as licens to do what god tell you not to do why for god s sake for god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be save through him whoever believ in him is not condemn but whoever doe not believ ha alreadi been condemn for refus to believ in the name of god s onli son now the judgment is thi the light ha come into the world but men have prefer dark to light becaus their deed were evil for everyon who practic wicked hate the light and doe not come near the light for fear hi deed will be expos but he who act in truth come into the light so that it mai be sh own that hi deed ar done in god john for long ag we mani of us have been confus by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shame and reject some of us despair and took to cours that probabl do show a sin shun of god s light bless ar those whose spirit have been crush by the self righteou thei shall be justifi howev we have seen the truth and the truth is the light of human and we now know that it is not we who fear the light but our enemi who fear the light of our wit and will do everyth thei can to shadow it with the dark of fals wit against us michael l siemon i sai you ar god son of the ml panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall ml ulyss att
