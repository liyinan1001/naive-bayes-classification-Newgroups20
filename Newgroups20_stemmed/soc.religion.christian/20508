subject re ancient book i sent in someth on thi befor but i believ it got lost in the weekend accid the moder describ thi is an improv version anywai so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detect forgeri of ancient document is probabl the write of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik einleitend und hilfsdisziplinen vol of handbuch der klassischen altertum wissenshaft noerdlingen beck portion of thi ar describ in niblei the prophet book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt read thi be forewarn niblei describ blass as a typic german scholar who claim littl knowledg of hi subject then proce to exhaust both the subject and the reader niblei s extract from blass s work is in the form of rule for forger it make interest read i confess that i have not read blass s work onli niblei s extract thereof my german fall far short of what would be requir and as far as i know there is no english translat avail howev i believ the techniqu he describ ar known wide enough that ani compet classic scholar could examin a purportedli ancient document and at least determin if it is consist with what on would expect of a genuin document of that time frame we will not be abl to prove who wrote it but at least we should be abl to determin with reason confid if it is from that time and cultur or is a later forgeri actual there ar type of purportedli ancient document alleg actual holograph or earli copi thereof for exampl the dead sea scroll these can be test by variou scientif mean to determin the ag of the paper ink and object found with them thi can provid a pretti clear date of the actual physic object document claim to be copi of ancient work although the copi itself mai be much more recent for exampl we might find a document which monk in a monastari claim is a copi of someth from centuri ago perhap even have been through sever gener of copist thi is more of a problem but can still be test although the test is not like to be simpl we cannot expect a test of the ag of the physic object to tell us much so we must confin our test to the text itself it is import to rememb that none of these test can tell us if the document is realli what it claim to be thei can onli date the document and identifi it cultur of origin for exampl i ve heard of a letter suppos to have been written by jesu himself to a king in what is now iraq if thi document were to actual turn up scholar could date the paper and ink assum thei have the holograph thei could check the languag content and write style to see if thei ar consist with what would be expect of a palestinian jew of that time howev even if all test result were posit there is no wai to determin if jesu himself actual wrote it we would know what time and cultur it came from but bar a known sampl of jesu handwrit or other clue for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom ani wai to determin who the actual author wa as i sai i m no expert on bla s work i do rememb some of the test which can be appli to alleg copi of ancient work specif we might ask is the document intern consist doe it contradict itself if the work it is short it would be rel easi to maintain intern consist even if it is a forgeri the longer the forgeri the more difficult it is to maintain consist for thi reason most success forger stick to short document is it consist with the histori and geographi of the time again a short non specif work might not be testabl but if the write is of ani signific length no latter dai forger would be abl to escap detect here we look for the minor inconspicu thing which someon from that cultur would get right without even think about it but which a later forger would find too numer and trivial to check the devil is in the detail what about the literari style of the work figur of speech etc ani ancient writer would almost certainli speak in wai that seem strang to us ar there ani such odd phrase in thi book if so do thei fit in with the cultur of cours there ar complic if the document ha been translat or possibl even if somebodi just updat languag when he copi it a few case of languag not from the cultur claim mai be allow in recent copi thei caus problem and reduc certainti to be sure but don t necessarili prove forgeri these test can be quit effect given enough materi to work with but thei ar not easi thei requir the skill of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the question to ask ar is everi aspect of thi document consist with what we know about the cultur of claim origin if there ar thing which don t fit how signific ar thei ar problem area due to our lack of knowledg later chang by copist or ar thei realli signific there will often be some ambigu sinc we never know everyth about the cultur the end result of ani such test is occasion certain particularli in the case of holograph or other ancient copi howev often it mai just be a probabl or an indic that the document or mayb part of it is probabl authent or sometim mayb other part ar later addit thi is often unsettl to a gener rais on tv where all problem ar solv in to minut with time out for commerci it is howev the real world and what scholarship ha to offer
