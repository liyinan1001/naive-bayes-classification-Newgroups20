subject assur of hell i dream that the great judgment morn had dawn and the trumpet had blown i dream that the sinner had gather for judgment befor the white throne oh what weep and wail as the lost were told of their fate thei cri for the rock and the mountain thei prai but their prayer were too late the soul that had put off salvat not tonight i ll get save by and by no time now to think of religion ala he had found time to die and i saw a great white throne now some have protest by sai that the fear of hell is not good for motiv yet jesu thought it wa paul thought it wa paul said know therefor the terror of the lord we persuad men todai too much of our evangel is noth but soft soap and some of it is noth but evangel salesmanship we don t tell peopl anymor that there s such a thing as sin or that there s such a place as hell as jayn ha said thi doesn t mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit peopl over the head with a basebal bat yet the fact remain there is a place call hell a place so fear that god di to save us from have to experi it whatev you or i as christian do we should do whatev we can to win peopl to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from go to outer dark jesu in mt tell us that he didn t prepar hell for peopl he prepar it for the devil and hi angel no where in the bibl do i read anywher that god predestin anybodi to go to hell d l moodi us to sai that the elect ar the whosoev will and the nonelect ar the whosoev wont s whether or not that s theolog sound i couldn t defend but it practic jesu said to the peopl of israel ye would not now some of you mai not be student of the bibl heck some of you mai not be christian have you ever said to somebodi i don t believ in hell i believ in the religion of jesu but did you know that jesu talk more about hell than he did about heaven oh i believ in the religion of the sermon on the mount you find hell taught by jesu in the sermon on the mount you ll read that jesu talk about the tree be cast into the fire sever time he talk about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synopt matthew mark and luke jesu talk about hell not isaiah not mose not john the baptist though he did but jesu the son of god the great belov on preach about hell becaus he love peopl and didn t want to see them go there now if there is no hell then jesu preach in vain it wa our lord jesu not some angri baptist preacher that said where the worm never di and where the fire never goe out jesu said that it wa jesu who call hell a furnac of fire it wa jesu that us the word condemn and thi is the condemn that men love dark rather than light becaus their deed ar evil jesu said that how can we get it across to you that a love dy jesu preach about hell not onli that but he went through hell that s what calgari wa all about when my lord wa on the cross dark fell he call hell outer dark do you have thi idea that hell is a place where the gambler ar gambl over here the drunk ar get drunk over there and the prostitut ar prostitut their bodi over there that s not what hell is hell s not a parti there s no fellowship there he call it outer dark outer awai from god dark god is light no when he wa on the cross he wa made sin for you and for me god treat jesu the wai sinner have to be treat that s is a sober thought as my son would sai an awesom thought my god my god why hast thou forsaken me hell is isol there s no fellowship in hell there s no friendship in hell there s no love embrac in hell there s no hand shake in hell there s no word of encourag in hell i thirst it goe much deeper than physic thirst hell is etern crave with no satisfact the man whose life wa live for drug will crave it etern the man whose life wa live for the lust of a woman s bodi will crave it etern and not be satisfi on theologian ha put it thi wai and i think it deserv merit what is hell hell is just the kind of environ that match the intern condit of the lost in a recent post i wa try to rememb the founder of the word of life ministri i ve rememb hi name jack wertzen and found that the illustr that i gave wasn t hi hi illustr wa that he wa talk to hi barber and hi barber s wife and daughter had just recent been save and he wa comment about it to jack thei sing these song and read bibl vers and their prais thi and that i can t stand it jack do you think god would send me to hell jack answer by sai ye i think he would of cours the barber said what do you mean by that well if you can t stand live at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymn and prais to god now what would you do in heaven where thei ll do it for etern you d be miser becaus god love you he d put you where it would match what you realli ar it make a man think the crucifixion of jesu christ is a fact that necessit the etern exist of hell becaus on the cross he perform an etern act don t ask me how i don t know but he is god and he is the infinit etern and when he di he di an infinit etern death it is by that etern act that he purchas etern life for the whosoev will he suffer etern judgment a lot of peopl would like to detour around hell by sai everybodi is go to be save eventu univers my bibl sai no he ll separ them the sheep from the goat after you die there s a probationari period in which god prepar you for heaven no my bibl sai that it is appoint unto men onc to die and then come judgment some of the cultist believ in annihil after you die sssswish just like a mosquito you re squish out no in rev we ar told that their is etern exist in hell just as there is in heaven i don t enjoi make these kind of statement and mayb you don t enjoi listen to them but we have to preach the entir word of god there is a place call hell if i could give on vers of scriptur that could give ani hope that peopl aren t go there i d give it to you but i haven t found it that fact that there is a place call hell the fact that our god is a god of holi and must judg sin the fact that he ha made us the kind of creatur we ar and therefor we re respons the fact that he ha place us in a uni vers that ha purpos and design behind it the fact that sin is such an aw thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save us from hell lead us to two applic as i ve alreadi mention if you ar a christian you must worn other it not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridg is out know therefor the terror of lord we persuad men if you haven t accept jesu ar your savior you re take an aw chanc as i sai to the jehovah wit who no longer frequent my door if you ar right and i am wrong then i will have live a good life and will die and ceas to exist but if i am right and you ar wrong then you will die and suffer etern damnat i don t mean to make fun at thi point but it like dirti harri said you ve got to ask yourself do i feel lucki well do you a man s got to know hi limit don t be on of the whosoev wont s becaus while i wa yet a sinner he di for me there s no greater love than thi that a man lai down hi life for anoth rex
