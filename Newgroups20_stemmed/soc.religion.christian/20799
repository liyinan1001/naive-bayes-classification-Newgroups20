subject re the arrog of christian in articl geneva rutger edu gt b prism gatech edu boundari write dleonar andi bgsu edu pixi write deletia sig p s if you do sincer believ that a god exist why do you follow it blindli do the word question author mean anyth to you i defi ani theist to repli deletia formal i probabl should let thi pass it s not worth the time and it s not realli intend for me but i couldn t resist a person weak of mine jerkiu kneeu tragic incur the foundat for faith in god is reason without which the exist of god could not be proven that hi exist can be proven by reason is indisput cf my short treatis tradit proof for the exist of god and summa theologica not so i can prove that the exist of god is disput by show that peopl disput it thi is easi i disput that god exist simpl i miss your tradit proof treatis but the proof i rememb from the summa theolog the wai i think it wa were rather poor stuff the ontolog argument is about a billion time better imho i would think you d want non tradit proof consid the gener failur of the tradit proof at least the on i know of i am think of the ontolog argument the cosmolog argument and the teleolog argument those ar the on tradit enough to have funni name anywai now given that god exist and that hi exist can be proven by reason i assert that hi command must be follow blindli although in our fallen condit we must alwai have some measur of doubt about our faith why thi is the real question so to discuss it i ll assum god exist otherwis there is no heavenli author to babbl about becaus god is the first caus of all thing the first mover of matter the independ thing that requir noth els for it exist the measur of all that is perfect and the essenti be who give order to the univers logo pleas show thi is the case i am familiar with the first caus argument and i ll accept for the sake of argument that there is a first caus even though i find some of it premic question the rest you ll have to show thi includ that the first caus is god i next assert that god is all good got it i deni that god is all good so there if thi is so then that which is contrari to the will of god is evil i e the absenc of the good and sinc god can never contradict himself then by hi promis of a savior as earli as the protoevangelium of genesi god instruct that becaus a human adam wa first respons for man s alien from the sourc of all good a man would be requir to act to restor the friendship thu god becam incarn in the person of the messiah thi isn t self consist if human must renew the relationship then god incarn or not can t do it well unless you think god is human grant god made himself human but thi is nonetheless cheat the intent of the statement is clearli that man ha to fix the problem he caus god fix it even by indirect mean contradict thi now thi messiah claim that he is the truth john if thi claim is true then we ar bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarn why also why assum said claim is true anywai if i claim to be truth ar you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have a problem with author have you tri the unit state marin corp yet i can tell you first hand that it is an excel instructor in author undoubt do you mean to impli we should all obei the command of the marin without question you seem to impli thi about god and that the marin ar similar in thi respect if thi is not what you ar try to sai thei pleas explain what it is you ar sai as i have miss it if you have not yet had the privileg i will repli that the author which is truth incarn mai never be question and thu must be follow blindli why why not question it even if it is truth we cannot know thi certainli so why is it so irrat to question perhap we will thu discov that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we can t question truth but i assert that god is not truth and anywai we can question truth how is it my assert is less good than your on mai not deni the truth oh i herebi deni i hope you ll agre is the truth grant i look pretti damn silli sai someth like that but i need someth we d both agre wa clearli true now you ll notic no stormtroop have march in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven light bolt either no mysteri net outag i seem to be permit to sai such thing absurd or not for exampl when the proverbi appl fell on isaac newton s head he could have deni that it happen but he did not the law of physic must be obei whether a human like them or not thei ar true thei ar certainli not true at least the on newton deriv ar not true and ar inde wildli inaccur at high speed or small distanc we do not have a set of law of physic that alwai work in all case if we did physic would be over alreadi scienc is all about question thi sort of truth if we didn t we d still follow aristotl i d gener thi a littl more if you want to learn anyth new you must question the thing you know tm becaus you can alwai be wrong therefor the author which is truth mai not be deni even presuppos that truth mai not be deni and mai not be question and that god is truth it onli follow that god mai not be deni or question not that he must be obei we could unquestioningli disobei him how annoi of us but you have not connect denial with disobedi dan no nicknam johnson and god said jeez thi is dull and it wa dull genesi these opinion probabl show what i know
