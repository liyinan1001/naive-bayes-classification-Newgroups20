subject monophysit and mike walker mike walker if you ar us the standard formula of fulli god and fulli human that i m not sure why you object to sai that jesu wa human i think the usual analysi would be that sin is not part of the basic definit of human it s a consequ of the fall jesu is human but not a fallen human clh the proper term for what mike express is monophysit thi wa a heresi that wa condemn in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorian which held that the son and jesu ar two differ peopl who happen to be unit in the same bodi temporarili monophysit is held by the copt of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobit of syria and the armenian orthodox it believ that jesu christ wa god which is correct that he wa man which is correct that he wa on person which is correct but that he had onli on natur and on will and oen energi which is heret the orthodox posit is that he had two natur and two will and two energi both divin and human though the will were in perfect harmoni that is what mike is try to get across that while jesu came in human form mike sai he did not have a human natur or a human will in realiti he had both though neither made him subject to origin sin it is interest to note that the monothelit were a reaction to thi conflict and attempt to solv the problem by admit two natur but not two will or two energi it also wa condemn at a late council in constantinopl i believ andi byler these issu get mighti subtl when you see peopl sai differ thing it s often hard to tell whether thei realli mean serious differ thing or whether thei ar us differ terminolog i don t think there s ani question that there is a problem with nestoriu and i would agre that the sai christ had a human form without a real human natur or will is heret but i d like to be a bit wari about the copt armenian etc recent discuss suggest that their monophysit posit mai not be as far from orthodoxi as mani had thought nestoriu wa an extrem repres of on of the two major school of thought more moder repres were regard as orthodox e g theodor of mopsuestia my impress is that the modern monophysit group inherit the entir tradit not just nestoriu version and that some of them mai have a suffici balanc posit to be regard as orthodox clh
