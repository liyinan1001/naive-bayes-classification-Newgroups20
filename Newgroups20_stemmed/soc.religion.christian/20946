subject re certainti and arrog in articl apr geneva rutger edu kilroi gboro rowan edu dr nanci s sweeti write someon call rexlex ha claim that there is a wai out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it wa prefer instead to paraphras sartr rambl about wittgenstein and sai that the conclus of my argument lead to relativ i will answer thi as i find time rexlex suggest that peopl read he is there and he is not silent by franci schaeffer i didn t think veri highli of it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossli overr by mani evangel christian somebodi els might like it though so don t let my opinion stop you from read it if someon is interest in my opinion i d suggest on certainti by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provin kilroi gboro rowan edu if ani substanti number of talk religion misc reader read some wittgenstein of the post would disappear if thei understood some wittgenstein would disappear michael l siemon notic what i said about thi book i call it easi read the reason i drop philosphi as my major wa becaus i ran into too mani pharisa simon s i don t know how mani walk encyclopedia s i ran across in philosphi class the problem isn t in know sooooo much more than your averag lai person the problem come when you becom puf up about it schaeffer is just fine for the averag lai person that wa who he wa writ to i suppos that you would have criticis john that hi gospel wa to simpl i ve talk with schaeffer on on on i ve been in lectur with the man when he wa be drill by philosphi student and prof s from secular as well as christian univers nd alon would fill both those catagori hi answer were enough that the prof s themselv often were taken back and caus to re think what their question wa i saw thi time and time again at differ open forum so ye schaeffer book ar by in larg well simplist it certainli isn t grad level read but we must get off our high hors when it come to recommend read do you serious think most peopl would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein i mai have more to sai about thi secular scientist at anoth time also on must final get beyond the doubt caus by insist inquisit on cannot live hi life constantli from a cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedli support genuin ration but we must add a qualif to give thi balanc christian is second to none in keep reason in it place we never know the valu of a thing until we know it limit put unlimit valu on someth and in the end you will exhaust it of all valu thi is why xianiti is thoroughli ration but not the least bit rationalist it also explain the curiou fact that it is ration and not christian faith which lead to irration if we forget the limit of a thing we fly in the face of realiti and condem ourselv to learn the simpl iron lesson of life more without limit is less less with limit is more or as i have so often state it freedom without form soon becom form w o freedom let s put it anoth wai the ration of faith is implac oppos to absurd but ha no quarrel with mysteri think about that it can tell the differ between the two if you will let it christian s content with ration is not that it ha too much reason in it but that it ha veri littl els when a christian come to faith hi understand and hi trust go hand in hand but as he continu in faith hi trust mai sometim be call to go on by itself without hi understand thi is where the principl of suspend judgment appli at such time if the christian faith is to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and sai father i do not understand you but i trust you now don t read all your object of me into that statement i wasn t sai i do not understand you at all but i trust you anywai it mean that i do not understand you in thi situat but i do understand why i trust you anywai therefor i can trust that you understand even though i do not the former is a mysteri unreliev by ration and indistinguish from absurd the latter is a statement of ration of faith walk hand in hand with the mysteri of faith so the principl of suspend judgment is not irrat it is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith as believ we cannot alwai know why but we canalwai know why we trust god who know why and thi make all the differ now there is on obviou snag to all thi and thi is where i have part compani with philosophi what is emin reason in theori is a rather bit more difficult in practic in practic the pressur of mysteri act on faith like the insist why of a year old it isn t just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannot know the on produc frustrat becaus curios is deni the other lead to genuin anguish more specif the poorer our understand is in come to faith the more necessari it will be to understand everyth after come to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will alwai need to know exactli what god is do in order to trust him fail to grasp that we mai not be abl to trust him for anyth we do not understand mai count decisev against what we ar abl to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be abl to trust him in situat where we do not understand what he is do too mani xian leader teach as if the christian had a window in the back of hi head which allow for understand at everi foot fall for what god is do mai be ambigu but it will not be inher contradictori it mai be mysteri to us but mysteri is onli inscrut what would be insuffer is absurd and that my friend wa the conclus of nietzch both in theori and in practic rex
