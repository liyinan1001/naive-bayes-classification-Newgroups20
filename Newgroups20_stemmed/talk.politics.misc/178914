subject re eight myth about nation health insur pt ii v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case write gld cunixb cc columbia edu gari l dare write you re not bui insur so much as be coerc into on insur plan no it is option as it is option for doctor to accept it there ar isol relig commun in particular that ask for exempt and on e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verifi for me that it is inde neg option i guess that you can argu that there is a right to have a particular insur but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pain to keep tab with new from home it s option but what if you don t want basic coverag on the govern s term you said befor that if you opt out you re basic uninsur there ar two thing at work here the public insur is veri wide in what it will cover as the amort is also univers no privat plan can boast of a plan that fit a gaussian curv and as our privat sector ha discov thei re better off not offer insur coverag that their custom ar go to us and that turn the privat insur offer the frill into an effect cartel thei don t realli need to compet becaus as you put it thei re in a win win situat and thei re guarante to turn a profit believ me thei probabl had orgasm when thei figur that out and accord to my sister the yuppi thei pat themselv on the back to the point of ungraci at chamber of commerc luncheon so in a sens thei ve stop be truli capitalist if thei don t have to worri about compet anymor you might sai that the total effect is on of social medicin a govern provid the basic and a cartel provid the extra there is no altern to the system desir or not the altern to the system is no system at all patient opt out doctor opt out or both but that onli for insur and you can t forc a privat insur compani to sell you a plan that thei will not offer and rememb that the actual health care is deliv by privat entiti who collect from the public insur voluntarili again thei can t forc a privat entiti to spring to life to pai them plu there is the matter of cultur and valu i m basic anti tax and anti govern by canadian standard yet i can t bring myself to make the same argument as you do despit that i understand where you re come from up north you re so much more like to find someon protest tax go to defenc than health insur premium to onli on fund for basic coverag interest side note have ani new insur compani start up from scratch sinc medicar becam standard in canada i actual have doubt that ani new on have emerg sinc ww i no scratch that there ar a few in western canada and quit a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracl out with the nation in with the french capit la group de cooper ant built a new tower by the eaton s store at le terrac and if you were abl to catch urban angel on cb s crimetim you d see it as the well lit on with doubl turret at the top as for ontario which still domin and anchor busi up north i meant new compani not new build ye primarili in quebec and in alberta sorri i musta lost you in that verbos blurb it s not realli insur if you don t have altern well you have to realiz that in our societi that s like sai that it s not realli nation defenc becaus you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opt out as a pacifist true but i would be more comfort with a system in which basic care provid by the govern wa option not mandatori in canada and germani it s not mandatori howev it is neg option in that you must request the exempt that the privat sector will not provid privat basic coverag if offer the option as in the quebec case tell me someth about what thei know either wai the transient situat ar hard to deal with sinc the chang in the privat medic care resourc take place at a slower rate than the abil of peopl to fall sick esp in the light of disast e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart diseas a doctor need year of train plu internship and specialti train anoth problem with the us system that should be resolv doesn t canada have someth like ten time the proport of gp to specialist that the us doe ye but part of the reason is that our most of our market ar too small to sustain mani specialist sometim not even on so you pretti well have to be a gp to get paid and if you do get the train the doctor monopoli might block your get of a licenc becaus there is alreadi someon in the busi and who cannot fill hi her appoint book that we have a cma doctor monopoli is someth that the american ama orient medic lobbi never tell you down here the problem is in a specialti your skill often directli correl to your pai a good cardiologist make more than a mere adequ cardiologist more than it doe in gener practic in that circumst it s hard to blame peopl for go into specialti no i respect peopl who do specialti okai all of my md friend ar but there s the question of our small market dynam up north if anyth that our privat doctor and hospit sell their servic to american to gener more busi will inflat their effect popul serv and thu make some specialti final viabl i e there will be enough custom we just do not have enough sick canadian in absolut number otherwis i person think an approach like germani s would be best where the compani compet for batch of peopl rochest a littl east of us wa abl to get almost all of it popul cover that wai uh germani basic us our method with their mani sick fund the competit is fake if it exist at all becaus thei re all interlink look in der spiegel or stern my girlfriend is in our german depart and her uncl is a privat practicion in saarbrucken no ad for health insur while canada organ by provinc germani organ the paperwork around big corpor and region offic but rememb that we have provinc that have the same popul as some major german corpor german have public health insur just that it is broker by smaller entiti actual brokerag of basic by privat firm who ll sell extra insur to fill out their polici sort of a voucher system wa on of the first idea float in canada too rememb the german don t have hmo s a tell sign co rochest doe and thei re also a compani town but there wa a washington post articl recent about that that said canadian doctor often us myelogram instead of mri which requir spinal inject and can caus seizur and headach mickei kau in the new republ probabl spoke for most american when he said who need that i think peopl here gener like to believ thei can easili get the most high tech treatment even if thei realli can t afford it i ll have to let a canadian md jump in to verifi that claim but i ve come to learn to suspect anyth in the american press about our system if much or some of it were true you d have to take us for idiot for toler it and given that our insur wa instal dure a period when there were onli liber and tori govern feder and provinci and the socialist ar still chafe thei would ve press for real social medicin to fix thing think about it after all we ar us the u s as a metric to make comparison both for keep up with the jones as for confirm that we did someth right gld je me souvien gari l dare gld columbia edu go winnipeg jet go gld cunixc bitnet selann domi stanlei
