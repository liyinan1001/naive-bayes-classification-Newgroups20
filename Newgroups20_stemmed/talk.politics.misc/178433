subject re eight myth about nation health insur pt ii v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case write gld cunixb cc columbia edu gari l dare write the differ in the litig environ is reflect in the fee lack of defens medicin and near absenc of malpractic is realli why we spend less us the most expens approach of pure insur and mayb that s not such a good thing i also read somewher that it is next to imposs in canada to litig against the health system class action suit ar nearli imposs and you can t sue the provinci health offici at all sinc our doctor ar privat and the system is just an insur plan litig would not involv the insur fund our lawyer do not work on conting so that if you were to sue for malpractic then you d better be sure of win to cover your fee likewis if you were a doctor and subject of a suit it s time to sweat sinc the provinci wing of the cma ar the on that go to bat when the fee schedul hike ar present the polit bent doctor were just cackl when thei realiz the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especi when unoppos unlik in social medicin approach like britain s nation health servic oh no don t let the ama know about thi thei have enough power as it is ask most american whether thei d like the doctor lobbi to get more power a few week ago the presid of the canadian ma wrote a letter to the nyt to decri a lobbyist s advert repeat the same old trash thi is signific becaus the ama and the cma ar interlink organ and he would not have done it without the approv of hi ama croni well yeah tell us about the nation defens medic centr outsid ottawa theoret it s limit to servic personnel but some studi i ve heard about have suggest that about half the patient there ar civilian who not onli have connect but aren t urgent at all it serv the same purpos as the bethesda naval hospit sinc not all hospit can provid everyth mayb thei have some stuff that other don t ottawa s popul is onli a quarter million if you includ the surround counti the problem is in a system where hospit annual budget ar approv by the govern how do you keep polit consider out of medic decis i bet that if you re an mp or mpp or good friend with on you re put on ani hospit s urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless you re someon who get bump off the list for some bigshot peopl of influenc will get their wai in ani system american or european it s the golden rule he who ha the gold make the rule as for annual budget those ar actual annual grant for facil e g mop pan etc given to hospit of which most ar privat nonprofit foundat btw i have no problem with have aggress for profit hospit like the french who us our approach but in the pari region thei have almost as mani peopl as canada doe so their market is much more divers the rest ha to be made up for by bill from patient who us their servic wouldn t nation health insur mean that american who ar now fulli insur might have to settl for less in canada provinci insur cover all health cost except dental care eyeglass prescript drug ambul servic and privat hospit room so mani canadian do end up bui some privat insur a polici to cover all of these thing run about to a month hmm how much differ would it make in the figur of percentag of gnp spent on health care if dentistri and optometri were includ in the account mayb canada spend proportion just as much on health care as we do the gdp figur ar combin public and privat expenditur for total outlai and ar compil us the same method by the oecd that yield the figur for the u s so what happen if the health care system financi collaps how thei ar collect premium and i m an advoc of have copay like the french do in their system in order to make it look more like the real insur that it is the privat doctor and hospit will still be there after the insur hypoth disappear as thei were there befor it appear bob rae the second least popular man in ontario warn ontarian a few year ago that if thei didn t stop cross border shop in such huge number the servic thei expect from the provinc just won t be there in a few year for on thing i think that bob rae is an idiot he didn t sai so but i knew he meant the ohip most of ohip come from separ premium on your paycheck if you ar a player he want to spend our monei on other thing than the health insur our high tax ar high for other spend but health insur which is separ and option and it is be spent in a nonpartisan manner by everi parti ohip is just a health insur plan it doe not provid ani kind of health care that is up to you and your privat doctor would the privat insur take up the slack thei d be under no oblig to of cours thei could eventu make monei again but if what you sai is true thei d be loath to do so and out of practic in handl such basic servic too some of the compani provid extra insur ar subsidiari of american compani and their parent provid full insur down here regardless all firm up north can easili turn on cabl tv to see how well the american firm ar do by be involv in basic coverag the privat firm ar make too much monei after have gotten rid of basic coverag thei run around pat them selv on the back for their own cooper in provid extra for those peopl who deserv it when privat insur realiz how much monei thei d make without the risk involv in basic insur e g neurosurgeri versu delux amen e g have to call granada tv to replac a rental set on the fritz in someon s privat hospit room thei start to pat themselv on the back for their social respons in quebec last spring a consortium of privat insur publicli warn against ani thought of privat routin low cost part of that provinc s public health insur plan again i doubt american would like give the insur compani that much power i half wonder if the canadian health insur didn t go along with the provinc and the feder govern year ago becaus thei knew that there wa a good chanc of the public system go bust in the long run and then afterward thei could clean up okai thi sort of contradict what i said higher up but it s anoth possibl thei d have an ad bonu when argu against govern involv in their industri as thei could then point to it failur instead of just cite theoret principl i agre thei were in a win win situat but right now it seem that thei have won bigger when you look at how full their coffer ar friend from my sister mba
