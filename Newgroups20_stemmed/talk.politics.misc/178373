subject the lesson of the nazi re david irv scholast fraud in respond to the post below i have consid issu far outsid the scope of revision and princip have consid the polit implic of a racist ideolog and it inevit outcom thu it is tangenti relev to soc histori and alt revision but i have direct followup to t p m sinc it is princip consider of the polit lesson to be drawn from the histori of the nazi parti that i deal with in articl apr oneb almanac bc ca kmcvai oneb almanac bc ca ken mcvai write as dawidowicz point out in the holocaust and the historian harvard univers press the nadir in hitlerolog is reach by david irv s hitler s war an amateur historian whose reput as a german apologist and as a writer without regard for accuraci or truth won him a measur of notorieti irv produc a page work intend to show that hitler wa kind to hi anim and to hi secretari that he wa probabl the weakest leader germani ha known in thi centuri and that he did not murder the jew or even wish to do so but that the murder wa commit behind hi back without hi knowledg or consent let us assum for the sake of argument that thi wa inde the case doe thi mean that hilter would have been in ani wai less guilti of mass murder becaus he aquiesc rather than particip as an activ and ardent support on of the import thing to realis about the nazi is that the system wa far more evil than ani singl member onc creat the nazi parti itself wa a murder machin that would inevit commit genocid there wa noon within it strong enough to prevent it rememb that hitler did not originali lead the nazi parti nor wa he particularli power within it until hi oratori allow the parti to come to power had hitler reneg upon the emotiaon expect which he had creat within the rank of hi support he would have been replac as he had himself replac the old guard who he beleiv were unabl to grasp the intellectu implic of their rhetor thi is why all parti that espous nazi style race supremaci ideolog must be consid as danger and as evil as the nazi the idea that on race of peopl is inher superior to anoth and that the greatest goal of human is to achiev racial perfect ha onli on logic outcom the ga chamber of auschwitz the nazi parti is not simpli the tale of a suprem evil singl man who lead an entir countri astrai beyond the evil of individu there wa the evil of the system itself which wa self gener and self perpetu hitler wa an extreemli evil person who built hi parti arround an ego cult center on the demonstr of hi own power thi doe not howev mean that he wa as entir free from polit constraint as he and hi propagandist work so hard to assert the myth that racism can produc a strong govern that can cure a nation ill must be emphat reject in the same wai we must accept a distinct between a govenr that demonstr it strength and on that is abl to govern decis in the manner it beleiv is best i would accept onli the latter as a strong govern sinc most displai of strength ar made necessari by an essenti weak it is import to understand that the nazi were not stupid nor were thei amor in the sens that thei lack moral scrupl thei act in the same manner as the spanish inquisit murder and tortur in the caus of moral the fault of the nazi li in their axiom not in their logic nor in their implement of those axiom thu all such parti such as the nation front or david duke klu klux klan front who assert the truth of those axiom must be consid for what thei ar advoc of a system that would commit genocid the conclus that hitler wa not onli respons but imens evil is inescap from the histor record it is import though to not let the conclus be reach that the nazi espous a set of idea that were basic correct but had an unfortun propon the evil of the concept of race supremaci ar primari although thi most emphaticali doe not excus individu culpabl thi is nevertheless secondari no matter what the promis made by a racist supremacist parti upon elect those promis will be broken as soon as circumst permit if thi requir the replac of the leader that origin made the pledg that will occur hatr is a suprem justifi it also creat a dynam of it own when those in govern allow it reign for mani in govern polit is a method of provid a justif for their own exist through a demonstr of their import a rhetor of hatr inevit develop the question of action sinc the continu exist of an object of hatr is inevit a remind of the essenti impot of the politician thu we have the us raid on tripoli which ha littl purpos beyond a demonstr of power it is import to realis that there is no quantum jump between the polit of the right and those of the extreem right but a progress from the reinforc of popular predjudic to action be taken on the basi of that predjudic in the same wai the extreem left trace their rout to despot through their assert of the subjug of the individu to ideolog it is import though that in attempt to understand the dynam of polit system that thi is not us to excus the particip the leader of a nation take on a suprem moral burden but not onli do so voluntarili ar requir to stive to do so thu to take on such a task without a fundament examin of the logic progress of on set of axiom to it conclus in itself is a moral crime furthermor in take on such a duti on is oblig to put the interest of the whole befor person concern even of person secur although it wa inevit that a parti such as the nazi base upon hatr and an idolis of the symbol of power should have saught to commit genocid it wa not inevit that thei should succeed each member of the system had an abil to creat a chang within it that had a possibl of chang the dynam realis that the individu cannot hope to control a system doe not mean accept that the individu cannot affect the system
