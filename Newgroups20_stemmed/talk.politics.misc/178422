than the hous of lord than we d almost have to state that the hous of repres wa also in fact thei both were becaus the british govern had much greater power than did the american system in principl no in practic ye in principl no that thei had less power of that thei should have had less power the british parliament in principl ha absolut power so doe the monarch much of the stabil of the system rest on what is not defin clearli in the case of a clear abus by on side or the other the other side can act to remedi the situat two institut with absolut power cute let s talk practic shall we if the monarch tri to do someth what would happen if thei were to start from a social welfar model instead of the current no state subsidi motto thei would be better place as it is there is plenti of state monei be hand out the problem is that it is distribut on the basi of power in congress and not on the basi of actual need bingo the higher up the government ladder the less actual need matter becaus polit power can be concentr at higher level while peopl with less cloud onli find themselv reduc to in effect that wa not my point but you illustr the problem veri well in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pai off the other state with pork defens contract agricultur subsidi etc or to be precis of the state sinc you need to beat the filibust then why not simpli leav new york s educ to new york i remain unconcinv that there is ani state in the union which is not capabl of educ it own children if that s what thei want to do the point is of redistribut of cash from the poor area of the ecconomi to the rich on i am contend that there is no state in the union which doe not have ampl wealth if thei choos to spend it to run a perfectli accept educ system i further contend that the amount of monei be spent now is more then suffici but is be spent badli or vice versa if you aren t a republican so tell me phill were the republican also respons for some of the huge increas in social program or were thei onli respons for what you don t like i contend it is congress which is to blame democrat and republican alik if societi simpli write off ani area of the countri that is ecconom weak you end up with a basket case ecconomi there ar inevit cycl in ani busi some of these act in phase to produc the busi cycl other ar countercycl local can experi boom to bust cycl outsid the nation trend to produc a strong ecconomi you need to ensur that the bust area do not fall bellow the level where thei cannot be ecconom rebuilt most of our worst area ar still better off than most of europ in ani case we re talk about educ if the industri in an area collaps the us as a whole still ha a respons to ensur that the children in that area get a good educ in some area of the us school ar close halfwai through the year for lack of monei ye i live in onc such area you re woefulli ignor of the situat at the same time some of tennesse s school district ar close down the governor ask for million dollar for bicentennti celebr licens plat in almost the same breath he want to rais unemploy compens and reduc tax which paid into it i don t know about the rest of the countri but our educ problem stem directli from two problem neither of which ar a lack of monei in the state btw tennesse is consid a tax heaven and our economi is on of the strongest in the countri i see a correl what monei we spend goe primarli to administr the averag administr make two and a half time what the averag teacher make and suck up an enorm amount of revenu and the governor is make a concert effort to creat an educ crisi in order to push for hi pet incom tax some of the most idiot program get fund like state fund for new art in the counti seat while school ar close it s not a lack of fund it s an unwilling to spend them on what is more appropri educ is the parent hot button educ is alwai the first to but cut becaus it s easier to get peopl to pai for their children than ugli art the u s constitut is a nut and bolt document the delcar of independ wa the high brow reason there ar a coupl of other exampl though such as the reason for the power to tax and the reason for the power to grant permit both in articl i section the declar on independ cam a decad earlier and ha not a line of justif for the us constitut you could argu that it went into the broad concept but littl more it spoke veri eloqu on govern be base on the consent of the govern in fact it is littl more than a protract whing more to do with the price of tea than the design of a govern it would be a pretti daft idea for a bunch of gui to sit arround design the structur of the new govern while the littl matter of the british armi remain to be settl thei did it anywai the continent congress had it own set of bylaw it wasn t quit a govern but a mean of make decis had to be creat howev low georg washington s opinion of them were to a certain extend i do believ the veto ha becom someth it wasn t intend howev i also believ it is inevit consid the congress own abus of their power to make bill sai whatev thei want them to sai unlik most peopl i think we shouldn t be worri about the veto which is fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessit it abus the congress is the most democrat bodi in the whole system allow me again to speak heresi against the holi democrat order so what the govern wa built with a veri non democrat presid with fairli broad power includ the veto it ha not onli the fairest system of elect but the two year term mean that the member have alwai got a recent mandat ye and the senat wa intend to act as a balanc to thi too much democraci wa intention avoid it wa consid a good thing to place non democrat block to impuls action on the other hand if the period of elect were to be made year in antiphas to the presidenti cycl there would be much less depend on fund rais from special interest than there is at present so long as congress ha someth to sell peopl will pai for it most congressmen rake in more monei than thei need why not what is inher wrong with bias the system against action histor governemnt action in the u s when deal with issu with a bare minor and a larg minor have not been success when you re in a posit of impos feder power on divers peopl why should the feder govern not have to got through someth more than a bare major in other word david think that the reactionari should need onli vote while progress should need no if the progress don t want the reactionari to move backward thei get the same benefit of the state is a lot of peopl and histor law with that sort of minor arent veri effect especi sinc it is usual geograph concentr when wield the feder big stick i don t see why thei shouldn t have to make a better argument than more peopl than not agre now we know why nobodi call the republican democrat i m not a republican i m a republican and no i m neither a democrat nor a democrat now i ve ask sever time and all you ve done is answer it isn t democrat which i knew befor i said it why should it be democrat we don t have a true direct democraci and few peopl advoc on why then is thi other modif of democraci to bia it against action so much wors david veal univ of tenn div of cont educ info servic group pa utkvm utk edu i still rememb the wai you laugh the dai your push me down
