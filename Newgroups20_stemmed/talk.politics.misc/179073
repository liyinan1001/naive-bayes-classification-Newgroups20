know the presid is go to come out at p m with your indulg i think what we d like to do is have the presid award the nation teacher s award first and then have the teacher leav or whatev and then he ll make a statement on waco and take a coupl question so if we can just hold off go live and all that until that s done it probabl will work out a lot better q if you ll give us the time that s the problem q we ve got a two minut warn problem mr stephanopoulo ye it is a problem it s about p m q the teacher would walk off and then mr stephanopoulo i think that s i m just try to work thi out here i think that s the best wai to handl it q can i ask you a seri of question about the wai the presid handl the notif yesterdai mr stephanopoulo sure q did you for instanc talk to the justic depart about who would come out and discuss what had happen in waco and whether it should be the attornei gener or the presid mr stephanopoulo why don t we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequenc of event on the contact between the justic depart and the white hous as you know and as we ve said the presid spoke with the attornei gener on sundai sundai afternoon thei had a good discuss about minut the attornei gener inform the presid of what she want to do he rais no object obvious she had the implicit author from the presid to go forward he rais no object she went forward thei had a discuss of a gener natur about the incid again yesterdai morn around a m the presid spoke with the attornei gener again thei had a brief discuss over what wa happen in waco as you know thi wa befor the fire broke out at the compound and i think that wa why there wa some just some confus i think that she wa confus in her mind befor and after the fire not the actual dai when thei spoke then there wa a number of contact at a number of differ level in the white hous yesterdai afternoon between the justic depart and the white hous thei were inform us of their decis what thei would like to do there wa an fbi brief in waco the attornei gener had her press confer the presid then issu a statement after that frankli yesterdai afternoon you know there wa a fair amount of confus over exactli what wa happen on the ground in waco and i think that we want to be veri care not to have the presid sai anyth until we had a much better sens of what wa actual happen on the ground onc we were fairli clear on what wa happen on the ground in waco the presid issu a statement he spoke with the attornei gener again yesterdai even q at what hour wa that mr stephanopoulo it wa quit late i believ it wa after he return from the holocaust museum he took a tour of the holocaust museum last night q and he went out to dinner mr stephanopoulo i believ briefli ye he went to dinner and then he spoke with the attornei gener last night i don t know the exact time i think it wa rel late and he just said i think as dee dee ha report that he just want to tell her that he thought she handl a difficult situat veri well that she did a good job in a tough situat and that she should try and get some sleep he then again spoke with her thi morn about the follow up in waco and about what thei re go to do thi afternoon as you know the presid will have an announc to make at q did he ever talk with webb hubbel yesterdai last night or thi morn mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledg no q wa webb hubbel the point man for the white hous mr stephanopoulo webb hubbel is the gener white hous liaison and sever peopl talk to webb the attornei gener wa run the oper q did he tell her that she should sleep well that she had done a good job or he just tell her that she should get some sleep mr stephanopoulo i think sleep well done a good job i don t know the exact word i think that sound right q i mean sleep well ha implic as to conscienc and whether she should feel badli about it or not mr stephanopoulo well i mean i think everybodi feel badli when you have a situat when q i understand that but whether the issu of blame is brought up in that phraseolog mr stephanopoulo i think that s the spirit no it ha noth to do with that the spirit with which it wa offer wa that the entir administr and certainli the attornei gener had to face a veri difficult decis a veri difficult situat yesterdai and that he thought that she had handl it well as best as she could and q well doe he think it wa mishandl mr stephanopoulo it wa just speak of warm word to a friend q doe he think the situat wa mishandl mr stephanopoulo the presid q in retrospect mr stephanopoulo the presid stand by the decis of the law enforc agenc the decis of the attornei gener he accept full respons at the same time i think that we all want to look to the futur and figur out what exactli happen do a full review and make sure we do what we can to make sure thi doesn t happen thi kind of thing doesn t happen again or at least we know how to handl it q how much did he know about what she wa go to go ahead with i know that she made the case to him explain outlin the case for action did she sai to him on sundai precis what action mr stephanopoulo i don t think it wa specif oper detail as to what wa go to happen i think that thei had a gener discuss about the action about the advis of action i think as she note he ask a few gener question just try to get a sens of how thing were consid but it wasn t minut by minut detail of how the oper q well wa it we ar go in is it we re go to us tear ga i mean what mr stephanopoulo i believ it wa that we want to go in and take some action that would increas the pressur on those in the compound and hopefulli spur them toward some sort of movement out q georg wa there ever a consciou polit decis made or even a discuss about distanc the presid from mr stephanopoulo not at all i mean we were in close contact with the justic depart the presid accept respons for thi at the same time i mean we just want to be veri veri clear about how thi happen and be as factual as we could be on how the decis were made it is the respons of those on the ground to make recommend the attornei gener ha oper control over thi the presid obvious accept respons for all of thi and he stand by the attornei gener q georg there wa a report on the televis todai and i don t know more than that on of the member of the cult had said go into a courthous that the fbi had start the fire and not themselv there wa also a pictur yesterdai on the tv of a smash into the build where the fire broke out and my question is is the white hous absolut certain that thi fire wa mr stephanopoulo all the evid we have is that thi fire wa start by david koresh and those insid the compound everi bit of evid we have q did the presid ask the attornei gener why do thi now why thi particular date and did he ask about possibl consequ of either death or injuri mr stephanopoulo i don t know the specif question he had gener question about how the decis wa go about be made q those ar gener question and did he ask gener why now mr stephanopoulo i think he ask have you consid all of the consequ have you consid the recommend i don t know if he ask the question why now i don t know if he ask that specif question q did she tell him why now in term of the stuff that s come out sinc then about the inform provid by the listen devic about koresh get increasingli more violent mr stephanopoulo again i m not certain how much specif detail thei got into i know that she gener said that thi is the recommend she s prepar to make i mean the decis she s prepar to make it s base on the recommend she wa receiv from the field and after intens question of those involv again i do not know how precis detail it wa beyond that q what is the presid s understand why yesterdai on of the peopl who went into the compound a coupl week ago came out over the weekend with some specul that he mai have told law enforc peopl someth that precipit thi action why yesterdai mr stephanopoulo thi is the first i ve heard i think what we can go to is what the fbi and the attornei gener ha said there were indic that those insid the compound were at some danger it wa clear that the negoti had broken down and it wa the judgment of the expert involv in the negoti that the situat wa not go to get ani better at all there wa also some concern over the vulner of the agent themselv who had been work long beyond the time that these team normal have to work and as the attornei gener ha said there wa some concern over the fact that thei did not have replac in place who could stand in for them and there wa a concern over the safeti all of these factor came into plai thei also consid the advic of a number of psychologist and other expert on david koresh and those in the compound i would just go back to what the attornei gener ha said you have to make the best judgment you can given the inform you have at the time thei did obvious we all regret the loss of life it s a terribl unfortun situat we all wish it could have turn out differ but that doesn t take awai from the judgment that were made at the time q georg when did the presid know that thei were go to us tear ga wa it befor the assault on the compound mr stephanopoulo i just don t know i don t believ he wa given a lot of detail on exactli how the oper would go i just don t know q along that point georg can you sai whether the plan wa present to the presid by the attornei gener as a wai to end the standoff on wai or the other yesterdai mr stephanopoulo i think it wa present as a wai to increas the pressur on those in the compound and we all hope as a wai to move some of those out and bring it in it wasn t present as tomorrow is d dai thi is it q is the presid satisfi that a he had all thi relev inform necessari to make a decis and b that janet reno had all the relev inform necessari to make a decis mr stephanopoulo oh i think he s satisfi that thei were act on the best advic and the best inform thei had and he s not second guess it in ani wai whatsoev q georg wa there a hour gap between convers between the presid and the attornei gener in other word thei spoke at a m and thei didn t speak again until clinton got back from dinner at mr stephanopoulo i think that s like ye q did he call her what time did she call wa there a gap between when she call him i mean wa he at dinner when she call and mr stephanopoulo no no no i think he call her last night i couldn t swear to it but i believ he call her last night he just want to talk to her q what wa go on mr stephanopoulo not that i know of no q what do you know about the situat now everyon ha perish who except eight or nine and do you know ani of the other detail mr stephanopoulo i don t know ani more detail than the fbi report in waco q watch cnn or how wa he keep track of what is go on if he wasn t talk to hi attornei gener how wa he keep track of what wa go on here i mean with all due respect to cnn is that how he wa do it mr stephanopoulo no there wa also as i said sever peopl in the white hous were in constant contact with their counterpart at justic to have the full and complet inform q who were those contact i mean wa it mack mclarti webb hubbel how wa the presid be kept inform that s not a mr stephanopoulo i believ mack wa in contact with webb i spoke with sever peopl at the justic depart i believ bruce lindsei spoke with peopl at the justic depart either berni or vinc wa also in contact at differ time dure the dai with peopl at the justic depart we were fulli brief and fulli inform q we were told thi morn that the presid mai have spoken a chanc that he mai have spoken with webb do you know if that s true or not mr stephanopoulo i think there s a chanc he mai have i don t believ he did but i think there s certainli a chanc that he mai have at some point i don t believ he did i think that the last contact he had dure the dai yesterdai directli with the justic depart wa the a m phone call with the attornei gener but the white hous wa fulli inform on a minut to minut basi of what wa happen in waco and what wa happen at the justic depart q georg who decid that the brief would be done by the attornei gener mr stephanopoulo the attornei gener q did you or did the white hous commun staff were you ever involv with that decis mr stephanopoulo no we were told about it q did you ask her to go on nightlin and macneil lehrer and all that stuff wa that part of mr stephanopoulo no q there wa no advic from the white hous at all about her she wa on all night all dai laughter mr stephanopoulo ye and she did a veri good job q why did you decid to have the presid s reaction to the situat be onli a written statement which is tradition the white hous s wai of distanc the presid from the issu not have him appear as person sai anyth mr stephanopoulo well that wasn t the intent at all as i said we had to we want to wait until we had all of the inform at hand the presid is also make a statement todai the presid made a statement yesterdai morn the presid ha been fulli involv q after thi turn into less than a success oper the onli statement from the presid wa what wa on paper after the attornei gener had alreadi given what amount to the major fact in thi mr stephanopoulo well it wa the first statement from the presid not the onli statement from the presid number on q after the mr stephanopoulo number two well the first number two the attornei gener q he gave a statement earli in the morn when the thing wa start to move mr stephanopoulo right and he gave on yesterdai and he s give on todai now the second point q it just happen thi wa a written statement with no sort of commun polici or thought process involv it wa the presid want to put out a written statement mr stephanopoulo know what we knew at the time we thought it wa appropri for the presid and he thought it wa appropri to put out a written statement express hi regret and express hi support for the attornei gener s q why wa it not appropri for him to person do someth mr stephanopoulo well he did person do so that is hi statement it s a statement under hi name q georg yesterdai dure the brief you didn t sai the presid took full respons for what happen mr stephanopoulo i certainli did q no what you said wa mr stephanopoulo that s just not right susan q well i think you can go back to the transcript i mean unless i miss someth mr stephanopoulo i d love to q janet reno said that she took full respons and you said that she made the decis that the fbi mr stephanopoulo and the presid take respons absolut q took respons all right mr stephanopoulo check the transcript q consid how littl wa known about what wa go on insid the compound and even now how littl is known why is washington call thi a mass suicid mr stephanopoulo well i think that know what we know now and given all of the action of david koresh befor and dure it is painfulli clear that those there were under hi control q it s stretch it a littl bit where the kid ar concern though isn t it georg mr stephanopoulo i think that that is an entir differ matter i mean i think that david koresh must bear respons for the death of those children absolut but he clearli wa intent on creat some kind of an apocalypt incid and that s what he did q you re still oper complet on assumpt right i mean you have no evid or you know of no evid that thi wa mass suicid mr stephanopoulo we have evid that those insid the compound set fire to the compound which led to the death of those insid q i didn t quit hear it thi might be ann s question i didn t quit hear it but at what time did clinton himself put out a statement on thi i know dee dee said some stuff on thi at p m but the presid put out mr stephanopoulo at p m p m q right after the even new went on the air mr stephanopoulo no right when we had all the inform we were work on it q dee dee confirm thi morn that the investig the presid is go to announc is go to be an administr run investig why not have someon from the outsid to make sure that it s not color by those who would have a polit stake particularli those at the atf whose action have alreadi been mr stephanopoulo i think that clearli the atf and the justic depart will bear respons for the investig that s not to rule out as is often in investig like thi have some sort of independ involv as well but it will be run by the treasuri and justic q ar you confid that you will not have ani problem get mr stephanopoulo absolut q georg did the presid reach out to anybodi els to get advic after the meet with janet reno and who els in the white hous sat in on that meet anyon els from justic mr stephanopoulo i don t believ anybodi els wa there at the time it wa a phone call on mondai it wasn t a meet q sundai mr stephanopoulo sundai it wa a phone call it wasn t a meet i believ he might have been there with bruce but beyond that i think he just talk to the attornei gener q georg you said that in that phone call she said that we want to go in and take action as you said that will forc him out what did he think she wa talk about if he didn t know about tear ga what exactli wa hi idea of what he wa approv mr stephanopoulo i think he wa approv an action to increas the pressur on q q it didn t matter how she did that mr stephanopoulo no no i mean q what inform did he have in term of how thi would proce presum he would have want to know not minut by minut but in a gener sens mr stephanopoulo i think he knew that thi wa the recommend of those on the ground and the recommend of the law enforc agenc i just don t know q what is thi when you sai that thi wa the recommend mr stephanopoulo the action to increas pressur i don t know exactli what he wa told whether he wa go to be told that the tank wa go to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window or whether he wa just told gener that thei were move forward in a wai that would increas the pressur i just don t know q it s hard to imagin him not ask though q that janet reno present him with as her best advic about what thei should go forward with he would have agre mr stephanopoulo he wa he did ask some gener question about the advic and recommend he gave at the same time and i would repeat that thi wa base on the unanim recommend of the law enforc agenc involv q georg it would seem that thi question about just exactli in what detail the presid wa inform about the natur of the oper is go to come up again here and elsewher can you take that question and mr stephanopoulo absolut ye q get the answer and come back to us with all of it mr stephanopoulo ye q can you tell us that there wa never a meet a strategi session where you and other decid we will put out a written statement from the presid and we will have janet reno be on all of these televis broadcast mr stephanopoulo never never q and you never call the justic depart and said to anyon or janet reno you re the on who need to be out front explain thi mr stephanopoulo not onc q it just happen that wai that she wa the spokesman that no on ever saw bill session until mr stephanopoulo she made a decis as attornei gener that it wa import for her as the oper offic in charg as the person who made the decis to go out and take the question on thi tragic incid q she had no guidanc from the white hous at all mr stephanopoulo we certainli didn t object q but did you laughter no i m sure you didn t object but did you suggest it wa thi a plan mr stephanopoulo no absolut not q a strategi mr stephanopoulo no q did she clear it mr stephanopoulo no q did she notifi you mr stephanopoulo we certainli knew about it q what happen to thi great detail process you have for clear and talk to everi public inform offic and everi under everi rock and everi place in govern that someth as major as thi could have occur without a discuss between you and the public inform peopl at least at the justic depart mr stephanopoulo the attornei gener made the decis and the attornei gener want to go forward it seem like a good decis it wa a good decis she did a good job q let me ask it thi wai georg if in hindsight how you would handl it mr stephanopoulo i think it wa handl veri well q you wouldn t chang a thing if mr stephanopoulo chang what q the wai the white hous handl ani part of it from start to finish mr stephanopoulo well i think that s an aw broad question and we re certainli go to have a review on of the reason for the investig is to look for wai in the futur that someth like thi see what we can learn from an incid like thi and see what we can learn about how to handl them if you re talk specif about the issu of the press confer no there wouldn t make ani chang at all q two question first of all on her go on tv no white hous peopl or outsid media consult came up with thi idea it s just veri reminisc of what you gui did dure the campaign mr stephanopoulo how so q i m think of like watch clinton on nightlin after the draft stori watch clinton on mr stephanopoulo there s absolut no comparison yesterdai there wa a law enforc incid the incid end in tragic death of mani mani peopl the attornei gener wa involv in that decis the attornei gener made the decis to do that she felt it wa her respons in the interest of public inform to go out and take the question of the press in order to make sure that all of the question were answer and she did a fantast job q the second question is did as someon who know clinton as well as you do can you understand why it s sort of hard to believ that he might not have ask some detail question about what she intend to do in other word she came and she said i m go to put pressur on them it s hard not to see clinton who s fairli intellig and inquisit ask how q what kind mr stephanopoulo both the attornei gener said that he did ask question he did ask gener question i don t have a minut by minut account of the convers q how long a convers mr stephanopoulo i think it wa about minut q telephon convers mr stephanopoulo ye q georg wa the feder cost of thi standoff ever a consider in term of step up the pressur mr stephanopoulo i don t believ so no q georg you keep sai that the presid take full respons but then you refer to it as her decis doe the presid not accept the fact that as command in chief it is ultim hi decis mr stephanopoulo i don t know what thi ha to do with command in chief thi wa a law enforc action not a militari action and he clearli take respons for the decis of the law enforc agenc involv taken in hi govern i mean i think there s just no ambigu about that q but is he accept it as hi decis as well as her or is he sai it s her decis there s a differ mr stephanopoulo as a matter of fact it wa her decis he did not object to that decis he clearli take full respons q georg thi brief ha gone on just a littl over minut and as you can see a lot of thing can be exchang what exactli did thei spend minut talk about if it wa just veri gener that s a long period of time in a phone convers mr stephanopoulo it is an aw long phone convers it wa a veri import phone convers i think brit ha ask that we take the question and i ve said that i would q on of the thing reno said last night is that the buck stop here i think that wa her direct quotat doe the presid agre with that in thi case mr stephanopoulo the presid sai he accept full respons i think what the attornei gener wa sai is that she made a decis that she s go to accept all the respons that come to her and she s not shrink from that at all but neither is the presid q at ani point in the convers last night between the presid and the attornei gener or thi morn did she ever offer her a resign mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledg q even befor the fire wa out yesterdai there were some republican on capitol hill call for an investig is the white hous at all concern about the time of those request try to make polit hai out of thi situat mr stephanopoulo no and i don t want to cast ani question about the motiv of those who ar request investig we want an investig and we ll have a full and complet investig q in what forum will you answer brit s question will you put out a written statement will you the wire how will you answer the question that you ve taken mr stephanopoulo i m just not sure q georg can you remind us what the presid wa do all yesterdai afternoon where he wa and what meet he wa involv in mr stephanopoulo i ll have to try and rememb he had a seri of meet with differ member of the staff dure the afternoon he wa certainli monitor the situat in waco and get period report on that as well he did see some on cnn as well i believ he saw a fair amount of the fbi press brief as well q and those report would have come to him from mack mclarti would thei do you think mr stephanopoulo mack talk to him bruce talk to him i talk to him q georg to follow helen s question in their convers thi morn did thei discuss at all her statement last night in respons to the question about whether she would resign did he sai i don t know why you felt the need to sai that i m here to reassur you that you don t have to do thi did that come up at all mr stephanopoulo i don t know if it even came up that specif i know that the bulk of the convers wa discuss where do we go from here and what form the investig q the didn t talk at all about her kind of remark comment last night about mr stephanopoulo well i believ she wa ask a question q and her respons wa if the presid want me to i will mr stephanopoulo which would be i think the standard respons that most cabinet member would give i mean it s a condit statement q have a need to talk about whether person about whether the presid want her mr stephanopoulo i don t know if thei talk about it i mean what i learn about the convers wa that it wa larg about the investig itself and thi just didn t come up i did not ask the question if thei talk about q will you take that with the brit packag mr stephanopoulo certainli laughter q georg for the record doe the presid want her to resign i know dee dee answer thi morn mr stephanopoulo absolut not he support janet reno she s a good attornei gener she s done a good job she handl a difficult situat extrem well q georg doe the presid feel that he and janet reno were let down by the unanim profession advic from the law enforc expert on the ground mr stephanopoulo no and the presid is not second guess that decis and those recommend in ani wai that is not to sai that he doesn t regret the loss of life everybodi regret the loss of life in thi situat but the best judgment were made in a difficult situat base on the best inform we had q georg the minut convers wa the on on sundai is that correct mr stephanopoulo ye q how long wa the on at a m yesterdai morn mr stephanopoulo i don t know i ll take that question too q were these outsid expert that thei were consult with or expert within the atf and the fbi mr stephanopoulo you d have to ask them i m just not sure i know that there were sever expert q and also why weren t there replac for these peopl is the unit that small mr stephanopoulo again i think it is a veri small highli special unit but i think it s on of the kind of thing that the investig will examin q georg isn t there a factor here involv the fbi director normal a presid when he want to get inform doesn t onli ask the attornei gener i know the chain of command but presid talk to their fbi director in thi case throughout thi entir sieg he ha not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill session who is from waco and get expertis from him on what to do and what not to do mr stephanopoulo i think he talk to the fbi director well in the begin of the situat when it first broke out in waco at the same time the attornei gener bear the ultim respons and he wa get fulli brief from the attornei gener q don t you think the ambigu situat that director session is in ha some impact on the wai the presid is brief and on the wai that all of thi evolv mr stephanopoulo not at all i mean it s perfectli appropri that he be brief by the attornei gener and that the attornei gener ha supervisori author over the fbi director and that s follow the chain of command the press thank you end p m edt
