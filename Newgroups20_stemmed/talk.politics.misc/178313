to continu to learn to merg the natur of learn and work why it s import to honor the effort of peopl like jerri levin and nancy comb and pat irv and all of those who ar here i want to thank the secretari of labor and educ and all the peopl who work with them for sponsor thi and my good friend governor wilder for be here and for speak and all of the busi and local commun leader from the citi and counti and state level from around america who ar here thi ha been a pretti fun dai laughter i love hear the young peopl sing it wa music to my ear becaus it is their futur that we ar realli struggl about applaus a year and a half ago i began the quest to seek the presid becaus i wa concern about their futur becaus i believ that our countri which had alwai been a beacon of hope for the young had too littl opportun wa too divid among ourselv across line of incom and race and region and other wai without a vision to take us into the futur i enter with the hope that togeth we could creat more opportun and insist on much more respons from all of our peopl but in the process we might recreat the best of america s commun know that togeth we could alwai to more than we could individu and that we might secur our futur all of you here todai ar commit to that the job that jerri levin ha commit time warner to is symbol of the commit made by mani of the privat sector peopl who ar here and those who ar around the countri the work that nancy comb doe and the success of all the young peopl like those on thi stage and especi the eloqu statement octaviu jeffer all those thing show that togeth we know what we need to do and we re on the right track last juli when i wa travel across america s heartland in my luxuri bu i visit seneca high school in louisvil kentucki and there i met young peopl and busi peopl who were particip in the louisvil educ and employ partnership i saw what nancy comb talk about todai i saw how the young peopl were make an extra effort to succe both in school and at work i saw as i have seen mani time in my own state the principl illustr that octaviu ha talk about that for million of american young peopl it is realli an impedi to both their learn and their abil to be good worker to draw a sharp divid line between what is work and what is learn in the world in which we ar live the averag young person will chang the natur of work seven or eight time in a lifetim we must learn to merg the work world and the learn world much better and we must determin that all of our young peopl see the opportun that some of them have had showcas here todai whether you re in busi or in govern or in educ you know that we have a big job to do when it come to build a futur that realli honestli includ opportun for all of our peopl there ar still a lot of peopl who sai well thing ar pretti good here in washington and everyth s fine the best thing we can do about thi whole thing is noth thei all have job laughter all the peopl who sai that applaus thei all have health insur thei all have a pretti good educ and thei all have a pretti secur knowledg that thei ll be okai no matter what happen i sai that not to be either polit or unduli critic but to point out that on of the great challeng of thi ag for everi advanc nation everyon is to fulli develop the capac of all of it peopl and then find work for them to do all the european countri have higher unemploy rate than we do but also stronger support system for the unemploi the japanes unemploy rate ha been go up thei re go to adopt a stimulu that even if you count it in it most rigor term is three or four time bigger than the on that i have propos to creat job in west germani alon the unemploy rate is now about as high as our thi is a big problem for advanc nation it cost a lot of monei to add an extra employe with a lot of pressur from low wage produc in other countri that ar grow their own economi and try to provid new opportun for their peopl but it is especi import for america for two reason on is we have a whole lot of folk who unless we move aggress will not have the educ and skill we need to be competit and product in a nation like thi the second is even if we educ them all if there aren t job thei will be rob of the fruit of their educ labor peopl need to be abl to work in thi countri applaus we have alwai had some unemploy and inde some of it is normal you ve alwai got some peopl leav job and move around the countri and do first on thing and anoth we have now at thi moment in our histori the necess for all big organ includ the govern to reexamin the wai thei ar organ and who ask whether there ar too mani peopl work at some kind of job but in the whole we must still be abl to creat job in a countri like america to provid peopl with the chanc to work it s go to be difficult for me to make the welfar reform propos that i will make to congress in the next coupl of month it s go to be hard for me to make those work if at the end of all thi work to get off welfar there isn t a job applaus so we have two task on is to develop the capac of the american peopl to perform without regard to race or incom or the circumst of their birth the other is to make sure that there ar some opportun for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be reward with a paycheck it is a great challeng i do not pretend that all of the answer ar simpl but i know if you want to ask the american peopl all of them to be more respons if you want to recreat a sens of commun in thi countri that bridg the line of race and incom and region you have got to have opportun in that mix a part of our vision for america ha to be a futur for everi young person in thi countri who s will to plai by the rule and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow there ha to be someth at the end of that rainbow and that is what we ar basic here to talk about todai what can we all do as partner recogn none of us can do it alon to develop the capac of our peopl to succe wherev thei live and whatev their background and then what can we do to make sure that there s someth there for them to do the summer job program we re discuss todai is an integr part of that plan becaus it will promot the valu of work and opportun and fair commun it will put the peopl first and it doe have a partnership between the public and privat sector i said when i address the unit state congress in februari on thi program that i would seek to creat about extra summer job from govern sourc and then challeng the american busi commun to meet that target so that we can creat more than a million new summer job over and abov what had been creat befor mani mani peopl have respond to that challeng and jerri is just a shine exampl of that which ha been replic in thi room and around the countri peopl who ar go to do more than thei otherwis would in the privat sector to give young peopl a work experi and it is terribl import i want to emphas that thi summer job program is part of an overal commit to increas the capac of the american peopl from retrain defens worker who lose their job and other adult who need to acquir new skill to improv the transit from school to work for young peopl who don t go to colleg but do need at least two year of post high school train either on the job or in a commun colleg or a vocat set so that thei can be competit worker make it possibl for more peopl to go on to colleg who do want to go all these thing ar part and parcel of a comprehens plan it s also import as i said that we creat more job the emerg job program that i ask the congress to adopt would creat a half a million extra job over the next year and a half and that would reduc the unemploy rate by a half a percent it would also enabl us to absorb more young peopl come into the work forc in job that otherwis will not be creat it also will help a lot of citi and counti to invest in thing that need to be done at the grass root level project long delai water project sewer project park project new industri and particularli in small and medium size commun a whole rang of thing that will improv the economi and improv the environ the summer job program is an import part of that becaus we have tri for the first time through the work of the labor depart and the educ depart and through reach out to peopl like you to make thi more than just a on shot summer job program to integr it with privat sector effort to hopefulli replic it in each come summer to move these young peopl into further educ opportun and to further job opportun and to have a strong meaning educ compon to these summer job someth that the unit state govern ha never fulli emphas befor a lot of these young peopl as you well know becaus thei come from difficult background becaus thei go to school in difficult and challeng circumst need extra help in build their basic skill in math and languag reason and in other area and a lot of educ studi show that young peopl who have difficulti in school often forget as much as percent of what thei learn over the summer and then that ha to be repeat the next year what we ar try to do here is to give peopl the opportun to learn good work habit and to reinforc their learn skill and to put them togeth and then hopefulli over the next coupl of year if our entir program pass to give everi school in thi countri the opportun to have a good work and learn environ there will be more appli academ more opportun for peopl to learn and work dure the school year so that thi will not simpli be an isol moment for these young folk but will be a part of build a whole new educ experi a whole new work experi and move on a pathwai to a better futur the summer job program ar not design to be make work job thei re design to make a futur for the peopl hold the job and that s what thei will do in the process thei ll help to build local commun to strengthen local economi to solv local problem real job renov hous repair public build do cleric work provid nurs assist in hospit supervis and train children at child care center and learn all the wai challeng young peopl to learn while thei earn but let them earn you know it s veri difficult to make a case to peopl who have never seen opportun on their own street that thei should do thi that or the other thing if there s no evid of the opportun that s at the end of the effort i have not been spare in go for the last year and a half into place where it isn t exactli popular to sai it and sai i want to reform the welfar system i want to toughen child support i want to requir peopl to work i wa sick and tire of peopl be irrespons in the us of gun on the street and i want to chang all that but if you re go to summon peopl to greater respons you have to reward them when thei do the right thing with opportun applaus the young peopl we propos to put to work under our program will spend hour learn basic skill such as math read write either on the job in the classroom thei will stretch their mind as well as work up a sweat thei will have a sens of accomplish it will liter be a summer challeng but a challeng that will take them into a differ life so i want to ask all of you to support thi effort even as i as your presid support your effort at the end of the summer we will evalu all the young peopl who particip we ll see whether thei instead of fall behind over the summer academ as too mani young peopl do thei stai even or move ahead i suspect that thei will thi summer secretari reich and secretari rilei and i will be visit mani of your commun we ll realli try to learn from you which of these effort ar work what we should do next summer how we can build it in to what goe on dure the school year how we can build in our job train effort and the work that we do with your compani to make sens of thi whole thing so that we maxim the impact of the taxpay dollar and your privat invest as well we want to honor the compani and the commun the busi leader and the young peopl who do the veri best job thi summer and again i want to sai to all of you in privat busi who have match our effort i thank you and to all of you who haven t and those across the countri who mai listen or learn about thi event todai i want to implor other privat employ to stretch a littl bit to give other young peopl a chanc to work thi summer i m tell you we cannot go through anoth year when we don t give these children anyth to sai ye to if we exhort them to do right we ve got to be abl to reward them applaus when the other speaker were talk i wa sit up here on the platform listen and revel and thei got talk about work and i got to think about all the differ thing i ve done to make a live in my life when i wa i made a veri foolish short term busi invest i set up a comic book stand and sold two trunk full of comic book made more monei than i had ever had in my life but if i had save those trunk thei d be worth todai laughter that doe not mean young peopl should not be entrepreneuri it just mean that you can t forese a gener ahead i have mow yard and clear land and built hous and work in bodi shop and the part depart of a car dealership and i ve done a lot of differ thing for a live some peopl sai i got into polit to escap work laughter i learn someth from everi job i ever had but i grew up in a gener where i liter did not know a live soul without regard to race or incom who want to work who didn t have a job i grew up in a gener when all you had to realli sai to peopl is get an educ and you ll be all right you ll get a job and you ll make more monei next year than you did thi year now i live in a gener full of peopl most of whom don t make ani more monei in real dollar than thei did year ago and thei re work longer hour and thei re pai more for the basic of life and we ar now wonder whether we can creat the job that these young peopl want now i want to close by reemphas these two thing it doesn t matter what kind of econom polici thi administr pursu or how much product increas there ar in the privat sector if young american don t get a good educ don t learn how to work and can t be product those job will not be creat in thi countri machin will do the work or the work will be done off shore by peopl who have the same skill level and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wage so noth we can do econom will matter unless we build the skill and capac of america s work forc and anybodi that pretend otherwis is just kid on the other hand we need to be honest everi wealthi countri in the world includ the unit state is have difficulti creat job if i knew everyth that need to be done i d be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliber of congress and everyth els i don t have all the answer but i know thi do noth is not the answer applaus and so the job program that i have present to congress with the summer job with the monei for the citi and the counti through the commun develop program with the infrastructur monei is a small part of a big budget it is an attempt to engag in an experi to see whether or not with the economi recov in term of corpor profit we can give a littl boost to it give opportun to young peopl creat a half a million job and mayb get the engin go again most of the job in thi program ar go to be job in the privat sector not govern job even though it s govern monei and the lion s share of the work in rebuild the american economi obvious will come from the privat sector that s the kind of system we have and it work pretti well but thi is the challeng we have so i ask all of you here todai to support the summer job program to ask your friend and neighbor to support it to go back home and ask your employ to make a littl extra effort to do what you can to help me pass the fund to creat the job that the unit state govern should creat thi summer so that togeth we can have thi partnership becaus more than anyth els we have to give a futur a futur that our young peopl can believ in we need to send them a messag that here in america if you studi hard and work hard if you obei the law and contribut someth to your commun you will be reward by your countri you can build a futur from you own dream that ha alwai been the promis of america togeth that s what thi summer of challeng need to be a reaffirm of the promis of america for so mani young peopl to whom that promis ha been an illus we can make it a realiti thank you veri much applaus end a m edt
