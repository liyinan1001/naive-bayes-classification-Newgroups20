job for immun for highwai construct for the import program that will put peopl back to work right awai thi summer and the presid continu to believ hi program should be pass q will he compromis that s the question mr stephanopoulo well as you know the discuss ar go on thi morn in the senat betwen senat mitchel and senat dole let s see what thei come up with but the presid believ hi job program should go forward q georg would the presid be will to accept billion for on year which appar appear to be the compromis be offer by mr stephanopoulo well i don t know what is be offer by either side the senat discuss ar go on right now let s see what happen todai q would he go that far no matter what the republican have offer so far would he go that far billion per year mr stephanopoulo the presid believ that hi program should be pass at thi time clearli we re go to be will to listen to what the senat might or might not be abl to come up with but i m not go to get into figur right now let s see what happen q it s reason to assum isn t it from what ha happen so far that a compromis is go to be necessari in order to get a vote mr stephanopoulo well the republican seem more intrest in stop progress on the presid s job bill than in do someth to creat mr stephanopoulo well the republican seem more interest in stop progress on the presid s job bill than in do someth to creat real action real job thi summer for the american peopl i think there s no question about that there s been some frustrat of legisl activ over the last few dai q so you ll need to compromis to get your packag through mr stephanopoulo we ll see what happen with the convers between senat mitchel and senat dole thi morn q prepar to compromis mr stephanopoulo the presid s prepar to listen to what senat mitchel ha to sai thi morn after hi meet with senat dole q doe he feel that he ha been defeat in hi mr stephanopoulo not in the least in fact he s been veri success so far in the begin of hi term q how mr stephanopoulo he pass hi budget in record time in six week and it s a budget which reduc the deficit by billion over five year and it s a budget which provid for import invest in our futur right now we ve also had strong passag of hi job program through the hous simpli becaus a minor of republican in the senat choos to perpetu gridlock and hold up action on the presid s job program is not a sign that he is not succeed overal q he can t beat thi can he q the fact is thei can do that mr stephanopoulo well the republican can stop action there s no question about that q what ar you go to do about it q georg what do you know about these alleg note taken by bori yeltsin dure on of the meet in which it appear that the presid told bori yeltsin not to trust the japanes that when thei sai ye thei mean no mr stephanopoulo i think that s a complet misread of what happen at the meet the context of the convers wa that presid clinton wa actual reassur presid yeltsin at the time about hi convers with prime minist miyazawa over the kuril island and the prime minist s belief that japan would plai a construct role in the g process i mean thi wa a casual comment about japanes courtesi and etiquett but overal it wa in the context of a convers where he wa reassur presid yeltsin that he believ the japanes were seriou about their commit to the g process q ar you sai that the presid said that when the japanes sai ye thei mean no mr stephanopoulo that s not i don t know the exact word and there wa a much longer discuss about he did sai someth along the line that he believ that on thi issu prime minist miyazawa intend to realli go forward with the g process q have there been ani attempt to explain thi to the japanes becaus appar the japanes press ha pick thi up and there appear to be mr stephanopoulo i ve seen the report in the japanes press and it actual doe put the situat in context it doe talk about the japanes understand the japanes point of view i don t think it s go to be a problem i believ that there mai have been some diplomat context just to clear thing up but i m not posit q georg wa the specif comment that wa made specif to the kuril island situat or wa it a gener observ on japanes etiquett mr stephanopoulo the discuss wa about q the specif comment is what i m ask about that ha alleg to have been translat from the russian note when the japanes sai ye thei mean no mr stephanopoulo well it wa a combin i mean i don t think that s the whole sentenc i think that the specif comment wa a broad gener observ follow up by a specif finish to the sentenc where he said in thi case he believ that prime minist miyazawa mean to keep the commit q wa he sai it faceti first mr stephanopoulo i think it wa just a casual observ q and then you sai diplomat contact were made to clear it up ha the presid sent a messag mr stephanopoulo no i don t think the presid spoke i believ that secretari christoph ha made some call but i m not sure exactli how mani q well thi obvious is a bigger deal than you re make it out to be if christoph ha had to make some call mr stephanopoulo no no it wa just that we got the report in vancouv and the secretari want to make sure that it wa understood and make sure there wa absolut no mr stephanopoulo report in vancouv and the secretari want to make sure that it wa understood and make sure there is absolut no misunderstand and i don t believ there is on q what is our posit about the japanes that thei mai have to sai on thing but actuali mean anoth mr stephanopoulo no the posit on the japanes is as the presid state to presid yeltsin throughout the two dai he said that he had had a good convers with prime minist miazawa prior to the summit he reiter the u s posit the long stand support for the japanes posit on the kuril island but also reiter prime minist miazawa s commit to move forward on the g process and to plai a construct role and i think presid yeltsin wa veri glad to hear that q after listen to secretari christoph on iraq for the last few dai i m a littl confus what is the u s polici do you want to see saddam hussein overturn mr stephanopoulo it s the same polici that secretari christoph ha reiter and all of the u s offici have reiter we expect full and complet and unequivoc complianc with all u n resolut right now we do not have that complianc q throw it out further that if iraq compli saddam can t stai in offic mr stephanopoulo right i think that that s our judgment is that it is not possibl for saddam hussein to compli with the resolut and stai in power but the import point is that we expect complianc by iraq with all u n resolut and we will continu to demand it q and ar you concern the iran will becom the domin power in the area mr stephanopoulo secretari christoph ha also spoken to iran over the last sever dai and he sai we also expect full iranian complianc with all intern norm and stop support of terror q that s a veri glib statement that he won t stai in power if he compli with u n resolut on what logic do you base that mr stephanopoulo right now saddam hussein is not compli with the u n resolut at all he is not respect the right of hi peopl as is requir by the u n resolut he is not fulli compli with all the resolut regard inspect he is not fulli compli with all the resolut regard armament q well when do you think that if he did compli he would be out of power mr stephanopoulo well right now hi power rest on the repress of hi peopl if he stop do that it would make it more difficult for him to stai in power q georg back on the stimulu packag why is it that you and the presid accus the republican of plai pure polit and perpetu gridlock why is it that what evid do you have that thei just don t have a genuin idealog differ with you that s in good faith mr stephanopoulo well the fact that sever time in the past the republican mani of the on who ar now lead the fight for the filibust have support the veri fund thei now seek to stop most especi the highwai fund q georg in regard to that some of the moder republican said that the white hous er by not be more open to them dure the while the plan wa put togeth that thei had on sort of proforma meet between the white hous and the senat republican and that wa it doe the administr look back and think perhap it could have done a better job of work with some mr stephanopoulo well i m not sure that it s true that there wa onli on meet i mean the presid met with the republican leadership on at least two occas befor the introduct of hi packag he met with the entir senat republican caucu also for lunch and went up there we ar continu in contact with as mani republican as we can find who have an interest in the presid s packag we ar interest in what thei have to sai as well but we believ that thi program is import and we re go to continu to fight for it q your all or noth do it with the democrat alon strategi did you mayb miscalcul the abil to get it through mr stephanopoulo well i mean i think that there is no question that under the senat rule a determin minor can frustrat activ i mean there is just no question about that you onli need plu on to keep go plu on to keep go and to stop ani action and that s what the republican ar do q go to rethink the wai you attempt to get other thing pass as you go through thi process for the rest of the summer q work with republican and try to woo some republican into your camp mr stephanopoulo i think we re go to continu to look for the support of republican whenev we can get it on the presid s inti q but on thi on how ar you go to do it differ than you did it on thi on becaus on thi on you realli did stiff the republican from the begin and made it clear that it wa a democrat major that would get thi through and could get it through and you realli didn t need republican vote ar you go to take a differ tack when you have to go for particular vote when you have to go through mr stephanopoulo i can t see into the futur and understand everi possibl turn in the legisl road clearli the presid s go to continu to reach out when he can q you don t have ani regret then about the wai you have handl it up to now and you don t plan ani chang in your approach in deal with the republican in congress base on thi experi mr stephanopoulo obvious the presid would like hi packag pass as quickli as possibl and he s go to continu to press for that we will continu to reach out to republican there s not question about that and we ll continu to reason with them and try and find appropri avenu for cooper in thi case the republican have chosen to unifi around a filibust around a plan to frustrat action not a plan to move forward q thei re be deni ani other legisl mean of put their propos forward mr stephanopoulo i think thei re be q ani idea mr stephanopoulo i think their amend ar be defeat i don t know that thei re be deni q to present them mr stephanopoulo that s not exactli true i mean thei get the vote q that their can be pass though by the parliamentari rule under which thei re plai mr stephanopoulo unless thei get a major in support all the wai around no that s not exactli true q georg on more on iraq is the administr back ani of the iraqi opposit groom ani new leadership q back ani of the iraqi leadership mr stephanopoulo oh i again we re press for iraqi complianc i don t know if we can get into the busi of groom leadership i believ there have been some contact at some level with iraqi opposit group i don t know about anyth recent q jess jackson who of cours is not the presid s best friend ha howev been told that there is to be some kind of town meet or some kind of involv by the presid pre empt the ball game lo angel will he consid someth like that or ani other kind of intervent there mr stephanopoulo well as you know the presid appoint commerc secretari ron brown about dai ago to be a special envoi to california and coordiant cabinet activ around the california econom situat includ the situat in lo angel i believ there will also be visit out to lo angel by the educ or have been visit by the educ secretari mr rilei i believ that transport secretari pena and hud secretari cisnero ar also go out and there mai be other visit by cabinet offici over the next sever dai and week i wouldn t rule out the possibl of a visit by presid clinton to california obvious he is follow the situat close and is concern about make sure that we make the right long term polici decis that will help creat the kind of econom opportun which help prevent disturb but we re go to continu to watch it q georg as a follow up reverend jackson is also suppos to be outsid the ball park todai in baltimor with a group of support protest the lack of minor in basebal manag doe the presid have a posit on that mr stephanopoulo the presid ha receiv correspond from reverend jackson i know that reverend jackson ha also spoken with the white hous chief of staff mack mclarti he clearli rais seriou question there ha been some progress in basebal over the last sever year but still not enough but the presid intend to continu to go to the ball game q is he go to sai anyth about it todai or see reverend jackson while he s out there mr stephanopoulo i don t know if he is go to see them but as i said the presid believ that reverend jackson ha rais some seriou question and it s someth that as i said even though there ha been progress it s clearli not enough q did reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball game mr stephanopoulo i m not sure about that i believ the character the reverend jackson is talk about is an inform pickett i don t know that he ask him not to go to the ball game but he sent a long detail formal letter outlin hi concern with the situat in major leagu basebal and the presid read it q georg the oriol ar plai the ranger the manag partner of the ranger is georg w bush is he go to be there and is he go to meet with the presid mr stephanopoulo i don t know q what is the mubarak schedul mr stephanopoulo i know that presid mubarak is come tomorrow morn for a work meet thei will have a lunch and i believ that he is have dinner tonight with vice presid gore q and joint statement tomorrow mr stephanopoulo i believ so ye at the end ye q is there evid georg that the egyptian did warn the u s about a potenti terrorist bomb terrorist activ mr stephanopoulo as report in the new york time i mean i think that presid mubarak did sai that there ha been gener convers with the egyptian as there have been for a long period of time we do have gener intellig share i mean but presid mubarak wa veri care to point out that there wa no specif inform on thi visit that wa pass forward the presid will continu to investig the situat but he also reiter hi belief that we cannot toler terror of ani kind q georg he did make specif or the egyptian appar did issu specif warn about thi individu who forgiv me thi individu who forgiv me the name escap me at the moment and said the egyptian were more or less rebuf in their attempt to get some kind of action mr stephanopoulo again i don t know if i would agre with your character of the mubarak interview he did sai that thei gave gener warn about the possibl of a network in the unit state and upon which we took appropri action but there wa no specif inform on thi specif oper at all q so the white hous doesn t feel that ani of the law enforc agenc whether it be the cia or fbi who would have receiv thi kind of inform wa lax or derelict in it duti in not pursu some kind of mr stephanopoulo no not at all q what s next with serbia it got onli a pass mention in the new confer yesterdai mr stephanopoulo you didn t get to ask your question q ye exactli wa there ani agreement on concert action between the two countri and even if there wasn t what doe the u s do next mr stephanopoulo i think the u s is clearli go to move forward in the u n todai continu discuss with our alli on a sanction resolut and we ll continu to look for wai to press the serbian to come to the negoti tabl and sign an agreement q georg why do you think sanction is still an option i mean the serbian make it clear that at least the leadership is surviv just fine and thei feel like thei can wait you out and even the administr offici we had in the other dai said there s no evid that thei re go to have an effect ani time soon the bosnian serb have said no to the peac plan when doe no mean no and you have to do someth differ mr stephanopoulo well i mean we ar do someth differ we re move forward on further sanction through the u n and those discuss will continu we re go to continu to try and tighten the noos on serbia and i think that everi opportun we have to do that will have an effect over time q ar we look again at lift the arm embargo mr stephanopoulo the presid ha said that thi is someth that is under consider q georg do you have ani more on hugh rodham s condit how he s do mr stephanopoulo as far as i know noth s chang q georg week after mr mubarak mr stephanopoulo it s a littl unclear i think we ll be abl to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morn after the mubarak visit q is he go somewher for easter mr stephanopoulo not that i know of q what more can you tell us about the addit aid to russia that the presid plan to ask congress about mr stephanopoulo he s go to be consult with the congress and with our g partner over the next coupl of week i know that he spoke last even with congressman gephardt and their deleg befor the the congression deleg meet with the russian thi week and those consult will continu over the next sever week q do you expect that packag to be of the magnitud of the on announc sundai mr stephanopoulo i m not go to discuss the magnitud q how about the list of cold war restrict where do you stand on that mr stephanopoulo as the presid said yesterdai he s go to be look for that list from the congress thi week and review it he believ he s go to try and get it thi week and he s go to review the list and we re go to take a hard look at it q but thei re make it up i mean it s no white hous involv congress is compil thi list mr stephanopoulo i think he s go to talk to the congression leader about compil the list but i m certain we ll be abl to get our own research work as well q georg isn t lift the arm embargo more of a probabl than a possibl mr stephanopoulo it s someth that s under discuss q secretari christoph ha said that it s a matter of time and for month befor that happen mr stephanopoulo again all i can sai is that it s someth that the presid is review right now we re work
