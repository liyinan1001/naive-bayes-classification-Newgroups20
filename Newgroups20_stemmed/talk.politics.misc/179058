subject clinton presid s press confer the white hous offic of the press secretari for immedi releas april press confer by the presid the east room p m edt the presid terri do you have a question q mr presid there s a grow feel that the western respons to bloodsh in bosnia ha been woefulli inadequ holocaust survivor eli wiesel ask you yesterdai to do someth anyth to stop the fight is the unit state consid take unilater action such as air strike against serb artilleri site the presid well first let me sai as you know for more than a week now we have been serious review our option for further action and i want to sai too let s look at the last three month sinc i becam presid i have work with our alli and we have tri to move forward first on the no fly zone on enforc of it on the humanitarian airdrop on the war crime investig on get the bosnian muslim involv in the peac process we have made some progress and now we have a veri much tougher sanction resolut and leon fuerth who is the nation secur advisor to the vice presid is in europ now work on implement that that is go to make a big differ to serbia and we ar review other option i think we should act we should lead the unit state should lead we have led for the last three month we have move the coalit and to be fair our alli in europ have been will to do their part and thei have troop on the ground there but i do not think we should act alon unilater nor do i think we will have to and in the next sever dai i think we will final the extens review which ha been go on and which ha taken a lot of my time as well as the time of the administr as it should have over the last dai or so i think we ll finish that in the near futur and then we ll have a polici and we ll announc it and everybodi can evalu it q can i follow up the presid sure q do you see ani parallel between the ethnic cleans in bosnia and the holocaust the presid i think the holocaust is on a whole differ level i think it is without preced or peer in human histori on the other hand ethnic cleans is the kind of inhuman that the holocaust took to the nth degre the idea of move peopl around and abus them and often kill them sole becaus of their ethnic is an abhorr thing and it is especi troublesom in that area where peopl of differ ethnic group live side by side for so long togeth and i think you have to stand up against it i think it s wrong we were talk todai about all of the other troubl in that region i wa happi to see the violenc between the croat and the muslim in bosnia subsid thi morn and i think we re make progress on that front but what s go on with the serbian and the ethnic cleans is qualit differ than the other conflict both within the former yugoslavia and in other part of the region q mr presid by ani count you have not had a good week in your presid the tragedi in waco the defeat of your stimulu bill the standoff in bosnia what did you do wrong and what ar you go to do differ how do you look at thing ar you reassess laughter the presid i don t realli believ that the situat in bosnia it s not been a good week for the world but i don t know that the administr could have made it differ on the stimulu packag i d like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in thi dai we have alreadi fundament chang the direct of an american govern we have abandon trickl down econom we ve abandon the polici that brought the debt of thi countri from trillion to trillion in onli a decad the budget plan which pass the congress which will reduc the deficit and increas invest ha led to a year low in mortgag rate dramat lower interest rate there ar probabl peopl in thi room who have refinanc their home mortgag in the last three month or who have had access to cheaper credit that s go to put ten of billion dollar cours throughout thi economi in wai that ar veri veri good for the countri and so we ar move in the right direct econom i regret that the stimulu did not pass and i have begun to ask and will continu to ask not onli peopl in the administr but peopl in the congress whether there is someth i could have done differ to pass that part of the reason it didn t pass wa polit part of it wa a differ in idea there ar realli peopl still who believ that it s not need i just disagre with that i think the recoveri the economist sai it s been underwai for about two year and we ve still had month of seven percent unemploy and all the wealthi countri ar have troubl creat job so i think there wa an idea base an argument there that while we re wait for the lower interest rate and the deficit reduct and the invest of the next four year to take effect thi sort of supplement appropri should go forward now i have to tell you i did misgaug that becaus a major of the republican senat now sit in the senat vote for a similar stimulu when ronald reagan wa presid in and vote time for regular supplement appropri like thi i just misgaug it and i hope that i can learn someth i ve just been here dai and you know i wa a governor work with a contenti legislatur for year and it took me a decad to get polit reform there so it take time to chang thing but i basic feel veri good about what s happen in the first dai with regard to the congress q waco the presid well with regard to waco i don t have much to add to what i ve alreadi said i think it is a i want the situat look into i want us to bring in peopl who have ani insight to bear on that i think it s veri import that the whole thing be thoroughli gone over but i still maintain what i said from the begin that the offend there wa david koresh and i do not think the unit state govern is respons for the fact that a bunch of fanat decid to kill themselv and i m sorri that thei kill their children q mr presid to follow up partli on helen on your stimulu packag and on your polit approach to capitol hill ross perot said todai that you re plai game with the american peopl in your tax polici he wa strongli critic of your stimulu packag he said he s go to launch an advertis campaign against the north american free trade agreement how ar you go to handl hi polit critic will it complic your effort on the hill with your econom plan and do you plan to repackag some of the thing that have been in your stimulu program and try to resubmit them to the hill the presid let me answer that question first we re go to revisit all of that over the next few dai i m go to be talk to member of congress and to other to see what we can do about that with regard to the econom plan i must sai i found that rather amaz i don t want to get into an argument with mr perot i ll be interest to hear what hi specif ar but i would go back and read hi book and hi plan there s a remark converg except that we have more specif budget cut we rais tax less on the middl class and more on the wealthi but otherwis the plan ar remark similar so i think it would be i ll be interest to see if mayb perhap he s chang hi posit from hi book last year and he ha some new idea to bring to bear i ll be glad to hear them q to follow up sir how do you plan to handl hi polit critic he s launch a campaign against you do you think you can sit back and just the presid well first of all i will ask you to appli the same level of scrutini to him as you do to me and if he s chang hi posit from the posit he took in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what hi idea ar mayb he s got some construct idea i think the american peopl have shown that thei re veri impati with peopl who don t want to produc result and the on thing i think that everybodi ha figur out about me in the last even if thei don t agre with what i do is that i want to get someth done i just came here to try to chang thing i want to do thing and i want to do thing that help peopl s live so my judgment is that if he make a suggest that is good that is construct that take us beyond some idea i ve propos that will chang peopl s live for the better fine but i think that that ought to be the test that we appli to everyon who weigh into thi debat and not just to the presid q mr presid to go back to bosnia for a minut you continu to insist that thi ha to be multilater action a criteria that seem to have hamstrung us when it come to mani option thu far and make it look as if thi is a state of paralysi the unit state is the last remain superpow why is it not appropri in thi situat for the unit state to act unilater the presid well the unit state sure you would agre that the unit state even as the last remain superpow ha to act consist with intern law under some mandat of the unit nation q but you have a mandat and the presid thei do and that is on of the thing that we have under review i haven t rule out ani option for action i would remind all of you i have not rule out ani option except that we have not discuss and we ar not consid the introduct of american forc into continu hostil there we ar not so we ar review other option but i also would remind you that to be fair our alli have had the french the british and the canadian have had troop on the ground there thei have been justifi worri about those but thei have support the airdrop the toughen of the sanction thei welcom the american deleg now in europ work on how to make these sanction realli work and realli bite against serbia and i can tell you that the other nation involv ar also genuin reassess their posit and i would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concert action that goe beyond where we have been i don t have ani critic of the british the french and other about that q would that be militari action q mr presid sever of the lead light in your administr rang from your fbi director to your u n ambassador to your deputi budget director to your health servic secretari have issu statement in the last coupl of week which ar absolut contradictori to some of the posit you ve taken in your administr why is that ar you lose your polit grip the presid give me an exampl q exampl judg session said that there wa no child abus in waco madelein albright ha said in thi morn s newspap at least that she favor air strike in bosnia all of these ar thing you said that you didn t support the presid first of all i don t know what we know that david koresh had sex with children i think that is undisput is it not is it not doe anybodi disput that where i come from that qualifi as child abus and we know that he had peopl teach these kid how to kill themselv i think that qualifi as abus and i m not critic judg session becaus i don t know exactli what he said in term of madelein albright madelein albright ha made no public statement at all about air strike there is a press report that she wrote me a confidenti letter in which she express her or memo in which she express her view about the new direct we should take in respons to my request to all the senior member of my administr to let me know what thei thought we ought to do next and i have heard from her and from other about what thei think we ought to do next and i m not go to discuss the recommend thei made to me but in the next few dai when i make a decis about what to do then i will announc what i m go to do so i wouldn t sai that either on of those exampl qualifi speak out of school q how about the valu ad tax mr presid the presid what wa that q the valu ad tax mr rivlin and miss shalala both said that thei thought that that wa a good idea the presid i don t mind them sai thei think it s a good idea there ar all kind of argument for it on polici ground that doe not mean that we have decid to incorpor it in the health care debat no decis ha been made on that and i have no object to their express their view on that we ve had a lot of peopl from busi and labor come to us sai that thei thought that tax would help make their particular industri more competit in the global economi i took no that wasn t take a line against an administr polici q mr presid a week ago a group of gai and lesbian repres came out of a meet with you and express in the most ring term their confid in your understand of them and their polit aspir and their belief that you would fulfil those aspir do you feel now that you will be abl to meet their now enhanc expect the presid well i don t know about that and i don t know what their it depend on what the expect ar but i ll tell you thi i believ that thi countri s polici should be heavili bias in favor of nondiscrimin i believ when you tell peopl thei can t do certain thing in thi countri that other peopl can do there ought to be an overwhelm and compel reason for it i believ we need the servic of all of our peopl and i have said that consist and not as a polit proposit the first time thi issu came up wa in when i wa in boston i wa just ask the question about it and i might add it s interest that i have been attack obvious those who disagre with me here ar primarili come from the polit right in america when i wa governor i wa attack from the other direct for stick up for the right of religi fundamentalist to run their child care center and to practic home school under appropri safeguard i just have alwai had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the right of american individu citizen to live up to the fullest of their capac and i m go to stick right with that q ar you concern sir that you mai have gener expect on their end and critic among other that ha hamstrung your administr in the sens of far too great emphasi on thi issu the presid ye but i have not place a great deal of emphasi on it it s gotten a lot of emphasi in other quarter and in the press i ve just simpli taken my posit and tri to see it through and that s what i do it doesn t take a lot of my time as presid to sai what i believ in and what i intend to do and that s what i ll continu to do q mr presid get back to the situat in bosnia and we understand you haven t made ani final decis on new option previous consid unaccept but the two most commonli heard option would be lift the arm embargo to enabl the bosnian muslim to defend themselv and to initi some limit air strike perhap to cut off suppli line without tell us your decis presum you haven t made ani final decis on those two option what ar the pro and con that ar go through your mind right now and will weigh heavili on your final decis the presid i m reluct to get into thi there ar those ar two of the option there ar some other option that have been consid all have pluse and minus all have support and oppon within the administr and in the congress where i would remind you heavi consult will be requir to embark on ani new polici i do believ that on the air strike issu the pronounc that gener powel ha made gener about militari action appli there if you take action if the unit state take action we must have a clearli defin object that can be met we must be abl to understand it and it limit must be clear the unit state is not should not becom involv as a partisan in a war with regard to the lift of the arm embargo the question obvious there is if you widen the capac of peopl to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peac will it lead to more bloodsh what kind of reaction can other have that would undermin the effect of the polici but i think both of them deserv some seriou consider along with some other option we have q do you think that these peopl who ar try to get us into war in bosnia ar realli rememb that we haven t taken care of hundr of thousand of veteran from the last war and we couldn t take care of our prison and get them all home from vietnam and now mani of them ar come up with bill for treatment of agent orang how can we afford to go to ani more of these war the presid well i think that s a good argument against the unit state itself becom involv as a belliger in a war there but we ar after all the world s onli super power we do have to lead the world and there is a veri seriou problem of systemat ethnic cleans in the former yugoslavia which could have not onli enorm further humanitarian consequ and good know there have been mani but also could have other practic consequ in other nearbi region where the same sort of ethnic tension exist q did you make ani kind of agreement with bori yeltsin to hold off either on air strike or ani kind of aggress action against the serb until after sundai and in gener how ha hi polit situat affect your deliber on bosnia the presid no i have not made ani agreement and he did not ask for that we never even discuss that interestingli enough the russian i would remind you in the middl of presid yeltsin s campaign abstain from our attempt to get tougher sanction through the unit nation in what i thought wa the proper decis for them and on that the unit state and i m sure the rest of the free world veri much appreci q do you wish mr presid that you d becom more involv in the plan of the waco oper and how would you handl that situat differ now the presid i don t think as a practic matter that the presid should becom involv in the plan of those kind of thing at that detail on of the thing that i m sure will come out when we look into thi is the question will be ask and answer did all of us who up the line of command ask the question we should have ask and get the answer we should have gotten and i look forward to that but at the time i have to sai as i did befor the first thing i did after the atf agent were kill onc we knew that the fbi wa go to go in wa to ask that the militari be consult becaus of the quasi as least militari natur of the conflict given the resourc that koresh had in hi compound and their obviou willing to us them and then on the dai befor the action i ask the question of the attornei gener which i have report to you previous and which at the time i thought were suffici i have as i said i m sure i leav it to other to make the suggest about whether there ar other question i should have ask q mr presid what is your assess of director session role in the waco affair and have you made a decis on hi futur and if you haven t will you give him a person hear befor you do decid the presid well first of all i have no assess of hi role sinc i had no direct contact with him and i mean no neg or posit infer i have no assess there i stand by what i said befor about my gener high regard for the fbi and i m wait for a recommend from the attornei gener about what to do with the direct of the fbi q mr presid sinc you said that on side in bosnia conflict repres inhuman that the holocaust carri to the nth degre why do you then tell us that the unit state cannot take a partisan view in thi war the presid well i said that the principl of ethnic cleans is someth we ought to stand up against that doe not mean that the unit state or the unit nation can enter a war in effect to redraw the line geograph line of republ within what wa yugoslavia or that that would ultim be success i think what the unit state ha to do is to try to figur out whether there is some wai consist with forc the peopl to resolv their own difficulti we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleans and that is obvious the difficulti we ar wrestl with thi is clearli the most difficult foreign polici problem we face and that all of our alli face and if it were easi i suppos it would have been solv befor we have tri to do more in the last dai than wa previous done it ha clearli not been enough to stop the serbian aggress and we ar now look at what els we can do q yesterdai you specif critic the roosevelt administr for not have bomb the railroad to the concentr camp and thing that were near militari target aren t there step like that that would not involv conflict direct conflict or partisan belliger that you might consid the presid there mai be i would remind you that the circumst were somewhat differ we were then at war with germani at the time and that s what made that whole incid so seri of incid so perplex but we have as i sai we ve got all of our option under review q the diplomat initi on haiti is on the verg of collaps what can you do to salvag it short of a full scale militari oper the presid well you mai know someth i don t that s not what our peopl tell me i think mr caputo and ambassador pezzullo have done togeth a good job the thing keep go back and forth becaus of the peopl who ar involv with the de facto govern there it s obviou what their concern ar thei were the same concern that led to the ouster of aristid in the first place and presid aristid we feel should be restor to power we re work toward that i get a report on that we discuss it at least three time a week and i m convinc that we re go to prevail there and be success i do believ that there s everi reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilater presenc to try to guarante the secur and the freedom from violenc of peopl on both side of the ledger while we try to establish the condit of ongo civil societi but i believ we re go to prevail there q mr presid would you care to make your assess of the first dai befor we make on for you laughter the presid well i ll sai if i believ first of all we pass the budget resolut in record time that wa the biggest issu that confirm the direct of the administr and confirm the commit of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increas invest and that we could do it by specif spend cut and by rais tax almost all of which come from the highest incom peopl in thi societi revers a year trend in which most of the tax burden were born by the middl class whose incom were go down when their tax were go up while the deficit went from trillion to trillion the total nation debt and the deficit continu to go up we have a year low in interest rate from mortgag we have lower interest rate across the board we have ten of billion of dollar flood back into thi economi as peopl refin their debt we have establish a new environment polici which is dramat differ the secretari of educ ha work with me and with other and with the governor to establish a new approach in educ that focus on tough standard as well as increas opportun we have done an enorm amount of work on polit reform on campaign financ and lobbi reform and i have impos tough ethic requir on my own administr s offici these thing ar consist with not onli what i said i d do in the campaign but with turn the countri around the vice presid is head a task forc which will liter chang the wai the feder govern oper and make it much more respons to the citizen of thi countri we ar work on a whole rang of other thing the welfar reform initi to move peopl from welfar to work and of cours a massiv amount of work ha been done on the health care issu which is a huge econom and person secur problem for million of american so i think it is amaz how much ha been done more will be done we also pass the famili leav bill a version of the motor voter bill that ha not come out of confer back to me yet and everyth ha been pass except the stimulu program so i think we re do fine and we re move in the right direct i feel good about it q sir a follow up wouldn t you sai though that on of your biggest initi aid to soviet russia is now practic finish if we can t pass a stimulu bill in our own countri how can we do it for them the presid let me recast the question a littl bit it s a good question laughter it s a good question but to be fair we ve got to recast it we have alreadi the first round of aid to the soviet to non soviet russia to a democrat russia is plainli go to go through the first billion the aid that we agre with our partner in the g to provid through the intern financi institut which is a big dollar item is plainli go to go through the question is can we get ani more aid for russia that requir a new appropri by the unit state congress and that is a question i think mari that will be resolv in the week ahead in part by what happen to the american worker and their job and their futur i think the two thing will be ti by mani member of congress q the tailhook report came out thi morn document horrend and nearli crimin conduct on the part of the navi how much did you discuss the incid and what might be done about it with your nomine to be the secretari of the navi the presid first let me comment a littl on that the inspector gener s report detail conduct which is wrong and which ha no place in the arm servic and i expect the report to be act on in the appropri wai i also want to sai to the american peopl and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is a veri disturb list of alleg which will have to be thoroughli examin it should not be taken as a gener indict of the unit state navi or of all the fine peopl who serv there it is veri specif in it alleg and it will be pursu the onli thing i said to the secretari design of the navi and the onli thing i should have said to him i think is that i expect him to take the report and to do hi duti and i believ he will do that q mr presid to back to russia for just a minut the latest poll show that mr yeltsin will probabl win hi vote of confid but there seem to be a real toss up on whether or not voter ar go to endors hi econom reform the presid i understand that q can you live with a split laughter can you live with a split decis though or do you need both pass in order to then build support for russian aid the presid i believ the answer to your question is for the unit state the kei question should be that which is pose to ani democraci which is who win the elect if he win the elect if he is ratifi by the russian peopl to continu as their presid then i think we should do our best to work with him toward reform you know we had a lot of other countri here for the holocaust museum dedic their leader were here leader from eastern europ leader from at least on republ of the former soviet union all of them have terribl econom challeng as thei convert from a communist command and control economi to a market economi in a world where there s econom slowdown everywher and in a world in which there s econom slowdown and difficulti all leader will have troubl have their polici be popular in a poll becaus thei haven t produc the result that the peopl so earnestli yearn for you can understand that but if thei have confid in the leadership i think that s all we can ask and the unit state will if the russian peopl ratifi him as their presid and stick with him then the unit state will continu to work with him i think he is a genuin democrat small d and genuin commit to reform i think that we should support that q mr presid mr perot ha come out strongli in what is perceiv behind the line against a free trade agreement nafta how hard ar you go to fight for thi free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplish the presid i think we ll have the agreement readi in the fairli near futur you know our peopl ar still work with the mexican govern and with the canadian on the side agreement we re try to work out what the environment agreement will sai what the labor agreement will sai and then what the fairest wai to deal with enforc is the mexican sai and there is some merit to their posit that thei re worri about transfer their sovereignti in enforc to a multilater commiss even in the unit state to be fair we have some folk who ar worri about that about give that up on the other hand if we re go to have an environment agreement and a labor standard agreement that mean someth then there ha to be ultim some consequ for violat them so what we re try to do is to agre on an approach which would sai that if there is a pattern of violat if you keep on violat it past a certain point mayb not an isol incid but a pattern of violat there is go to be some enforc there must be consequ and we re work out the detail of that but i still feel quit good about it and thi is just an area where i disagre with mr perot and with other i think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integr more close the mexican economi and the american economi and lead us from there to chile to other market economi in latin america and give us a bigger world in which to trade i think that s the onli wai a rich countri can grow richer if you look at what japan and other countri in the pacif ar do to reach out in their own region it s a pretti good lesson to us that we had better worri about how to build those bridg in our own area so thi is an idea battl you know you ve got a lot of question and i want to answer them all but let me sai not everi on of these thing can be distil simpli into polit you know who s for thi and who s for that and if thi person is for thi somebodi els ha got to be for that a lot of these thing honestli involv real debat over idea over who s right and wrong about the world toward which we re move and the answer ar not self evid and on of the reason that i want to run for presid is i want to sort of open the floodgat for debat these idea so that we could try to chang in the appropri wai so i just have a differ of opinion i believ that the concept of nafta is sound even though as you know i thought that the detail need to be improv q mr presid there wa a tremend flurri of interest earlier thi month in the russian document that purport to show that the vietnames had held back american prison gener vessei ha now said publicli that while the document itself wa authent he believ that it wa incorrect do you have a person view at thi point about that issu and more broadli do you believ that in fact the vietnames did return all the american prison at the time of the pari peac accord the presid first let me sai i saw gener vessei befor he went to vietnam and after he return and i have a high regard for him and i appreci hi willing to serv hi countri in thi wai as to whether the document had ani basi in fact let me sai that the govern of vietnam wa more forthcom than it had been in the past and gave us some document that would tend to undermin the valid of the russian document claim i do not know whether that is right or wrong we ar have it basic evalu at thi time and when we complet the evalu we ll tell you and of cours we want to tell the famili of those who were miss in action or who were pow i think that we ll be abl to make some progress in elimin some of the question about the outstand case as a result of thi last interchang but i cannot sai that i m fulli satisfi that we know all that we need to know there ar still some case that we don t know the answer to but i do believ we re make some progress i wa encourag by the last trip q i d like to follow up on that befor the u s normal relat allow trade to go forward do you have to be person sure that everi case ha been resolv or would you be will to go forward on the basi that while it mai take year to resolv these case the vietnames have made suffici offer to us to confirm good faith the presid a lot of expert sai you can never resolv everi case everi on that we couldn t resolv all the case for them and that there ar still some case that have not been factual resolv go back to the second world war but what i would have to be convinc of is that we had gone a long wai toward resolv everi case that could be resolv at thi moment in time and that there wa a complet open and unrestrict commit to continu to do everyth that could be done alwai to keep resolv those case and we re not there yet again i have to be guid a littl bit by peopl who know a lot about thi and i confess to be much more heavili influenc by the famili of the peopl whose live were lost there or whose live remain in question than by the commerci interest and the other thing which seem so compel in thi moment i just am veri influenc by how the famili feel q your econom stimulu packag ar you do some kind of realiti check now and scale back some of your plan your legisl plan for the come year includ the crime bill the health care initi and other thing ar there ani plan to do that and also did you underestim the power of senat bob dole the presid no what i underestim wa the extent to which what i thought wa a fairli self evid case particularli after we stai below the spend cap approv by thi congress includ the republican who were in thi congress last year when we had alreadi pass a budget resolut which call for over billion in deficit reduct when thei had vote repeatedli for supplement appropri to help foreign govern i thought at least four of them would vote to break clotur and i underestim that i did not have an adequ strategi of deal with that i also thought that if i made a good faith effort to negoti and to compromis that it would not be rebuf instead everi time i offer someth thei reduc the offer that thei had previous been talk to the major leader about so it wa a strang set of event but i think what happen wa what wa a signific part of our plan but not the major part of it acquir a polit connot that got out of proport to the merit so that a lot of republican were sai to me privat mr presid i d like to be for thi but i can t now and we re all strung out and we re divid and i think we need to do a realiti check as i said what i want to know let me go back to what i said what i want to know from our folk and from our friend in the senat on and republican or democrat is what could i have done differ to make it come out differ becaus the real loser here were not the presid and the administr the real loser were the hundr of thousand of peopl who won t have job now we could have put anoth kid to work thi summer i mean we could have done a lot of good thing with that monei and i think that is veri veri sad and it becam more polit than it should have but the underli rational i don t think hold a lot of water that it wa deficit spend that just won t wash q and redo the presid no i mean you know for exampl you mention the crime bill i think it would be a real mistak not to pass the crime bill i mean the crime bill wa almost on the point of passag last year and thei were all fight over the bradi bill sure sure after what we have been through in thi countri just in the last three month with the kind of mindless violenc we have seen we can pass a bill requir peopl to go through a wait period befor thei bui a handgun and sure we can see that we need more polic offic on the street that s anoth thing that i realli believ that onc we move some of that monei not all but some of it up into thi job packag to make some of the job rehir polic offic on the street who d been laid off that would be a compel case i mean peopl ar scare in thi countri and i think we need to go forward i feel veri strongli that we need to go forward on the crime bill q mr presid back to the tailhook report for a second that report contain veri strong critic of the navi s senior leadership in gener but did not name ani of the senior offic do you believ that the
