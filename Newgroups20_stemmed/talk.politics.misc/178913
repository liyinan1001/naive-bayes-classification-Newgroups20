subject re freedom of associ in articl pdb kilimanjaro jpl nasa gov pdb ipl jpl nasa gov paul bartholomew write a veri well put togeth post i disagre with sever kei point but the post is an excel on with which to engag in discours there ha been much discuss recent about the right to freedom of associ mr cramer and mr ronzon appear to take an absolutist posit on thi right that it is a fundament human right perhap the fundament human right and that it supersed other right such as the right to an equal opportun other feel that a right to an equal opportun outweigh the right to freedom of associ and thu we have the never end debat that flare up repeatedli freedom of associ foa involv the mutual and voluntari agreement of two or more peopl right to equal opportun let call it reo involv coercion in all case by definit a major problem is that neither of these right ar explicitli declar or protect in the constitut or in the declar of independ although both can be deriv from these document unfortun thi mean that the debat will never end becaus neither side can conclu sive prove the valid of their view it becom sole a matter of person philosophi ye there is much debat but no it can end with onc and for all recognit of these right well not total perfect end but end in the same wai that there is no worldwid disagr that sai murder is a crime my person opinion is that the real answer li somewher in between i regard both of these right as fundament human right which unfortu nate come into direct conflict with on anoth which is stronger depend on the given situat hmm there is even more discus about religion should we take a somewher in between approach toward the state a state recogn religion the first amend is so uh so absolutist you know for exampl if the owner of a mom and pop store wish to hire an employe to help out their right to freedom of associ outweigh the right of their job applic to an equal opportun thei should be free to hire whomev thei choos us whatev criteria thei choos without ani govern intervent at all similarli if a famili wish to rent out a bedroom in their home or a garag apart or someth similar then their right to freedom of associ outweigh the right of their prospect tenant to an equal opportun if on the other hand ibm a multi nation corpor with employe publicli own and oper by a board of director wish to hire addit employe then whose freedom of associ ar we protect the board of director the other employe the owner of the stock in thi case the applic s right to an equal opportun outweigh the right to freedom of associ and we as a societi can ask ibm to us onli those criteria which ar relev to the specif task why sai who why can mon pop have foa but ibm be forc and forc is the correct word here to have reo as purchas of ibm is voluntari then there ar veri well defin procedur on how ibm choos to do some thing and choos to do other thing why not let those same procedur work for employ polici similarli if a landlord own a number of apart build in which he doe not live and which ar manag by an independ manag agenc then whose freedom of associ ar we protect if the owner doe not live in hi build and ha no contact with hi tenant then the prospect tenant s right to an equal opportun outweigh the right to freedom of associ and we as a societi can ask the owner to us onli those criteria which ar relev to good tenant i ve put good in quotat mark becaus i realli don t want to be drawn off into the side issu of what constitut a good tenant why doe thi tenant have an option i won t call it a right to destroi the foa of the landlord if the landlord and the tenant can t agre then thei both can ceas from us each other s properti suddenli by arm wave by magic a landlord doe not have foa and on what basi doe the foa of the landlord disappear it seem that vagu term like no contact with tenant suffic well i think foa is on our most import rightt in the top and by golli if the state is go to make it suffer i sure would like to see the heinou crime that justifi the remov of thi right i don t think no contact with the tenat is even a crime much less someth that should caus sever interfer with import right i suspect that the major of the peopl in thi countri agre with my posit on these extrem case particularli if thei ar present in thi manner i don t know if mr ronzon or mr cramer would agre i suspect not in ani case addit problem aris when we try to appli guidelin for the middl ground what if the compani ha employe or or where do we draw the line between protect the right to freedom of associ and protect the right to an equal opportun right ar not defin by major mob choic foa is an absolut reo is a fanci name for thuggeri for racism and coercion the difficulti is that ani line we draw will of necess be artifici and ani legisl result will be flaw in the past the govern ha usual tri to pass law which refer to the number of employe hire by the compani e g ani compani with more than xxx employe wa affect by the law those with fewer were unaffect of cours it would be you dimli see that the line must be artifiaci becaus foa is the onli right just like a state religion you can t jsutifi that either gener i believ that if we do not have ani regul affect these right then the right to freedom of associ will be stronger on the other hand mani of the regul protect the right to an equal opportun too much weaken the right to freedom of associ i don t believ there is a satisfactori solut which will pleas everybodi a solut that i came up with is to us publicli own vs privat own as the divid line if the compani remain privat own then the owner should be free to do whatev thei want with their compani if the compani becom publicli own then the public ha a right to ask the compani to submit to addit regul why i assum that when you sai publicli own you ar talk about those quasi state compani that do not have sharehold the compani on the fortun for exampl ar all privat own thei can give you a list of all of their owner thei have no anonym unknown to them owner by the wai the abov analysi is base on the assumpt that the right to freedom of associ and the right to an equal opportun ar both fundament human right of equal import sinc thi is entir a matter of faith not subject to ani proof i do not choos to even try to establish thi you either accept it or you don t ani comment foa can be deriv by ani two ration peopl on a basi that neither ha evil malici or murder intent toward the other in short agreement is mutual or not at all your reo on the other hand live onli by accept coercion the gun into the situat and that is self destruct of the whole argument becaus it is base onli on might make right sort of like sai nobodi ha a right to live whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead end of argument there ar actual peopl that still believ love canal wa some kind of environment disast weird eh these opinion ar mine and you can t have em but i ll rent em cheap
