peopl who live in these commun i have alwai support commun polic not onli becaus it help to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate but becaus it cement better relationship between peopl in law enforc and the peopl that thei re hire to protect it reduc the chanc of abus action by polic offic and increas the chanc of harmoni and safe street at the same time these ar the kind of thing that we ar try to do i promis in my campaign that i d do everyth i could to put anoth polic offic on the street over the next four year thi make a good downpay on that thi keep in mind the core of the job packag and thi will help us to move forward so i ask the peopl in the senat who have block the job bill let s work togeth i can accept a reduc packag if you will increas your commit to safe street i do not accept the fact that we should reduc our commit to summer job or to build our infrastructur or to do those other thing that will creat real and last prosper for our peopl i have done my part now to end the gridlock i ask you to do your i want now to give the peopl who ar here with me on the platform a chanc to make some remark and to be heard by the american peopl begin with janet reno the distinguish attornei gener q mr presid can you tell us do you think that the job packag could be put in further jeopardi by controversi over the suggest of a vat tax at thi point in the congression dialogu the presid not at all i think it should have thei wouldn t have ani relationship on to the other first of all i made absolut no decis on that you should know that there s a lot of support in the busi commun and the labor commun peopl have ask us to consid that becaus of the enorm burden of the present system on mani of our major employ particularli mani of those that we depend upon to gener job and to carri the strength of thi economi but i have made absolut no decis that would even approach that on that or ani other kind of gener tax q do you person believ that the american public is readi to pai for to have anoth tax to pai for health care i mean apart from what busi and labor leader have said the presid i m not go to specul on that i will sai thi the real issu is how quickli we can recycl the benefit of all the save to cover the cost i mean that is everyon know that if you do what we re propos to do if you streamlin the insur system if you fix the system so that there s no longer an enorm econom incent to over util or over provid certain servic if you provid primari and prevent care in place where it isn t now everi singl analysi show absolut massiv save to the health care system the real question is whether you can transfer those save to cover those who have no coverag now or those who have virtual no coverag so that you provid peopl the secur i have no idea the poll sai that but i don t know all i know is the poll that i see in the press that mani of you have commiss thei sai overwhelmingli the american peopl want the secur of an afford health care system but i don t think that ha anyth to do with thi stimulu and it certainli shouldn t have peopl want a job first and foremost thei want that more than anyth els q now that you ve announc your willing to compromis on the stimulu packag can you tell us what part of your packag you consid vital and uncompromis i assum summer job is on the presid i want the summer job i want the highwai program and i want the polic program i still intend let me sai thi i still intend to fulli and aggress push the crime bill which did not pass the congress last year thi is a supplement to that not a substitut for it in ani wai but i think we need to do that i think we need the ryan white fund becaus of the enorm health care burden to the commun that ar inordin and disproportion affect by the problem of care for peopl with aid and there ar sever other thing that i think should be done we have to do the agricultur depart meat inspector the safeti of the public depend on that there ar a number of other thing that i don t i don t think ani of it should be cut but i have given senat mitchel and senat byrd i talk to them and senat dole call me yesterdai to discuss thi and i told him that i would call him back i call him back last night in new hampshir and we discuss thi and i basic ask them to talk todai and said that i would not make ani statement about ani specif until at least thei had a chanc to talk to see whether or not thei could reach some accord so i don t want to be ani more specif than i have been alreadi and let s see if thei can talk it out q when you talk to senat dole and senat mitchel did you tell them about your increas also that million that you want that as part of the packag the presid i did i told senat i left word for senat mitchel last night about it when i talk to senat dole i don t rememb for sure i do not believ i mention it but i did tell him that i wa prepar to reduc the packag and i want to break the gridlock and i told him that i wa work on a reformul of it so that in the hope that it would becom even more focus on job and the kind of issu that i thought the american peopl want us to address and thi is certainli consist with that thank you end p m edt
