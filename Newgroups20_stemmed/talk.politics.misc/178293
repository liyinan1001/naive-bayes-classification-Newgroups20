can do to educ and train our peopl better unless we do that none of the effort that all the rest of us make in govern even to bring the budget into balanc even to increas our invest in other thing which will grow job will last in the long run we also have to have peopl who can carri their load and in a world where the averag young person will chang job seven or eight time in a lifetim that begin with the educ system and continu into the work forc where educ must go on for a lifetim it s not just import what you know but what you can learn and if i might i d like to close just by emphas we re do our best to try to have the most innov partnership between the labor depart and the educ depart and the privat sector to build a good school to work transit and we re try to get off to a good start thi summer with a program that would creat more than new summer job includ mani thousand that have a strong educ compon so our young peopl can be learn and work at the same time dick i think i ought to stop there that s a good place we can begin i think the discuss secretari rilei thank you so much mr presid each month we get togeth and talk about wai that all citizen can work toward reach the nation educ goal and tonight we ll focu on goal five and how commun such as your can prepar student for thi world of work thi week the educ depart and the labor depart ar host a confer here in washington d c call summer challeng a program of work and learn to america s youth the aim is to us some special fund from presid clinton s propos econom stimulu packag to provid education enrich job and summer school program for young peopl in disadvantag area of the countri mr presid let s talk a minut you allud to it somewhat about the summer youth challeng your program call for more educ enrich in the summer job and why in your word is that so import the presid i think it s import for two reason first of all a lot of the young peopl we re try to reach mai have had troubl adjust to school and learn and while we want them to have a good experi with a real job we also want them to continu to learn dure the summer becaus we know from a lot of research that a lot of kid that have troubl learn in school mai forget as much as percent of what thei learn the previou year over the summertim and that is a veri unproduct thing for school to have to take up a lot of time teach what thei alreadi taught befor secondli we want to help these young peopl progress not onli in term of work but in term of learn we want to abolish the artifici divid line between what is work and what is learn becaus we think that the best and most product worker will have to be lifetim learner and we think that thi experi could mayb drive that point home and prepar these young peopl to succe in school or at work or in colleg as thei go on secretari rilei well i think the fact that these ar disadvantag kid that gap that lag you mention as thei go into the next year is realli even greater secretari reich of cours you have train program throughout the year and i wonder is you have ani comment about thi educ compon of train secretari reich well what we ve learn mr secretari is that for mani young peopl whether it s for the summer or for the year actual on the job work experi combin with educ is on of the best wai of learn mani young peopl for exampl have a lot thei have a difficult time learn geometri but when thei actual ar there build someth or work on someth and thei can see the exact and direct applic of geometri thei understand what it s us for and a lot of young peopl just that sens of connect between educ and the world of work is terribl terribl import it s import dure the summer but it s import for a lot of young peopl even beyond the summer secretari rilei thank you mr presid you ve call for a youth apprenticeship program school to work transit and i wonder if you would tell us a littl bit about your concept of that and how you see it develop the presid well first of all let s talk about why it s import most new job that will be creat in thi decad will not requir a four year colleg degre but most of them will requir some learn and skill that go well beyond what most peopl get in a high school diploma if you look at the last year the averag salari of young peopl that had at least two year of good post high school educ wa a good salari that went up over the decad the young peopl who had less than that tend to have lower wage that did not go up and in mani case in real term fell over the decad becaus thei weren t product thei weren t more valuabl to their employ so we think america ha a big econom interest in try to ensur that all the young peopl who get out of high school but don t go on to colleg make a transit to work which includ two year of further train either in a commun colleg a vocat set or perhap on the job and what i have done in thi budget as you know is to give you and secretari reich some fund and some incent to try to work in partnership with state and with the privat sector to build these program state by state in a wai that would be custom essenti by the busi commun base on the need of the economi in ani given area it could revolution long term the qualiti of the american work forc and the earn of american worker secretari reich i should add mr presid i think you know thi from your experi in arkansa and mani of the peopl watch thi program that the busi commun and educ labor group ar alreadi in mani of our commun mani of our state build a school to work transit program in fact there s an aw lot of ferment a lot of excit the peopl watch thi program probabl ar the on who ar most directli involv in that and more power to them secretari rilei and i ar go to do everyth we can to build on the success alreadi out there secretari rilei bob we re go to be talk tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co op learn career academi and what featur all those program that deal with thi subject what ar some of the featur that everi on of these school to work program might have that ar import secretari reich well on thing that we ve seen and you and i have been work at thi for a long time and you much longer than i we ve seen that activ involv of the busi commun is absolut essenti and i m so delight that we re do thi in the headquart of the chamber of commerc the chamber of commerc of the unit state is commit to do these kind of program train educ retrain and we ve aim to work veri close with the chamber the busi commun is go to be activ engag in develop almost an audit of the kind of job that ar need and help the educ commun colleg technic institut develop curricula that ar relev for the job of the futur commun have got to come togeth i mean thi is on of the most import thing you ve got to have all of these player in a commun come togeth and work togeth and cooper togeth you know too often we have the educ over here and the busi leader over here labor group over here and everybodi is talk but thei re not realli work togeth in a common strategi and the third and final ingredi i would sai dick would be a commit to excel a commit both to academ excel and also to skill develop excel thi is not a track program we re talk about for kid who ar not go to make it thi is a program that everi young person ought to be elig for if thei want to go on beyond that to four year colleg that s fine that ought to be permiss but we re talk about the foundat of learn about job the foundat skill for on the job learn and again those ar the critic compon it s alreadi be done the presid i think if i might just interject on point base on my person experi at home the busi commun ha a critic role to plai not simpli in sai here ar the job skill that ar need and here s what ought to be taught but also in monitor that excel if you have the right sort of partnership there the peopl who ar pai the tax and who ar go to then be hire the worker ar not go to permit the second rate program to surviv if thei have ani wai to shape and influenc them so i think that s veri import and when we try to if you will fill in the blank at the feder level try to set some standard and provid some fund on of the thing that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employ ha a heavi amount of influenc over the qualiti of these program becaus that s realli what s go to determin whether the whole thing is worthwhil secretari rilei that s great we ve been talk of cours about school to work and also the job and econom recoveri program for thi summer and fall but let s talk just a moment about long term school reform it s someth especi close to me mr presid i wonder if you would give us some of your idea for the commun out here on goal legisl that i think will be come forth befor too long the presid well as you know back when you and i were both governor we spent a lot of time work on our public school and we tri to be veri candid with our peopl in sai that a lot of these thing were go to take some time to materi i had a hand in write the nation educ goal that the governor draft along with repres of presid bush s administr back in and what we re go to try to do thi year with your leadership is to introduc legisl in congress that will actual defin the thing that the nation govern ought to do to try to help the local school and the children of thi countri and the adult learner too meet those goal make sure that when by peopl show up for school readi to learn that we get a percent on time high school graduat rate that children at the th th and th grade ar confid in the subject thei re suppos to know that thei ar second to none in math and scienc that ar school ar safe disciplin and drug free and of cours the fifth goal i took them out of line to sai thi the last is that we have a system of life long learn in thi countri and each on of those goal there s a nation role a state role a school role school district role and a privat sector role and what you ve attempt to do in thi bill you re go to introduc with me in the next few week is to defin what our job is and then to give the rest of america a wai of defin what their job is and see whether we re actual meet the standard of qualiti that we need to meet it s veri excit so far as i know noth quit like it ha ever been done in the form of feder legisl befor not mandat and tell peopl what thei have to do with their monei but actual set up a framework for excel and partnership so that we can do our job i m realli excit about it secretari rilei well i am too and i think realli it will be an entir new role for the feder govern in term of it relationship with state serv as a partner realli to support and facilit and to help out in these educ reform effort all driven by high standard that s the point bob let me ask you on question and then we ll get to the telephon call it s about the same subject we have of cours skill standard that ar go to be part of goal and i wonder if you would comment on that secretari reich well you know we have percent of our young peopl who don t graduat from colleg veri often thei don t have veri mani altern thei do have a wonder system of commun colleg and technic institut but if we had nation skill standard to which thei could aspir and which employ would understand as a nation credenti mani of these young peopl would actual find that thei were much more elig for job everybodi doesn t have to go to colleg other countri you have smaller proport of their popul go to colleg but you have a whole level of peopl who have certain technic preprofession skill we can do it in thi countri if you don t go to four year colleg you re not a loser and we want to develop those nation skill standard we re go to be work with the state with the educ depart with a lot of privat industri in develop those standard and i think thei will be the kind of thing that enabl our vocat and technic and other institut to ralli around as well as our busi commun secretari rilei well that s great why don t we go ahead and go to the telephon we have a call i see mayor bruce todd of austin texa q ye mr presid and mr secretari reich and rilei we certainli appreci the opportun to join you todai we have some dedic profession and volunt here in austin who have heard what you have said and ar veri appreci let me simpli sai amen to some of the comment made alreadi we agre with much of the tone that the clinton administr ha taken and ar veri support we have been success here in austin of tripl our summer employ program over the last four year we expect to have over emploi thi year in the summertim perhap as much as with the feder assist much of the question that we had design you have answer in your open comment so we must be think alik but the question essenti involv what initi after labor dai would be appropri we know summertim is import year round is even more import and what kind of initi at the feder level might be propos to meet the need of the youth on a year round basi and perhap more importantli how can famili and the local commun be more involv us the feder initi that s someth that we believ is veri import to success in thi effort secretari rilei mr presid the presid i think i ll give everybodi a chanc to answer the question bruce but let me first thank you for call and thank you for all the great work that you re do in austin i ve seen some of it and i ve alwai been veri impress first with regard to the summer program we hope we can structur it in a wai that will enabl us to continu the summer program and that will move a lot of these young peopl back into school under circumst that might allow them to do some work in the privat sector too we hope that secretari reich is go to try to set up a system where we creat a lot of privat sector job to be match with the public sector job thi summer and we re work on that secondli in the program that i have present to the congress over the next five year what we ar attempt to do is to build in an amount of invest that s quit substanti for job train program for school to work program all of which give heavi heavi weight to local commun input just the question you ask but do provid some feder invest dollar which we hope you can put with local dollar to keep peopl work and be train on a year round basi and i will sai again to echo what secretari reich said a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learn an aw lot of young peopl actual have quit high iq but actual learn so much better when thei re do than when thei re read or just listen so we hope that the commun involv part of it will be perman and we hope that if the whole budget pass and we do have budget cut and more than actual in the budget and some revenu raiser and some new monei for educ and train that we ll be abl to do just what you seem to want base on your question bob do you want to sai anyth secretari reich well you took most of the word out of my mouth mr presid as usual but let me just add on thing and that is that on of the most import aspect of post high school for a lot of young peopl who ar not go on to colleg in addit to the school to work program simpli is the avail of job and we ve got to get thi economi move again obvious it s terribl import to get thi recoveri program to get the economi back on track that s sort of the prerequisit to everyth els if we don t get the economi back on track we have i think thi is the th correct me if i m wrong mr presid i think is the th month we have had seven percent unemploy or greater thi is a jobless recoveri a lot of those kid ar go to be get out of school in june and even if we did everyth right thei would have a veri veri hard time get job secretari rilei thank you both of cours goal will be a perman long term thing that will certainli reach into next year it will involv if pass and we certainli hope it will be action plan with everi state where we can be work togeth to reach for the goal in a number of differ wai and then the state with all the variou school district a veri import part of that will be citizen and parent involv and i think everybodi will see a great energi out there onc we get that move the next call is dr harri heinemann new york doctor q good even mr secretari it is a pleasur to be on with you thi even as you mai know bridg the school and work ha been central to la guardia s educ program sinc it incept in the s and that includ the colleg the two altern high school that oper on our campu and the linkag we have forg with the local school we have found thi to be an extrem effect learn strategi and over the year we ve come to believ that there ar sever principl that ar veri import in bridg the school and work and these includ integr theori in the classroom with practic in the workplac with provid all student earli exposur to career as well as provid opportun for them to reflect upon these experi while thei strengthen their skill and lastli the critic role of the liber art particularli in the develop of high perform compet my question then is how can the gener educ faculti and the academ curriculum be more close integr with transit to work experi and what mechan and strategi can you suggest to achiev thi integr secretari rilei well thank you veri much i think and we ll get a respons from you all on that and veri interest work go on there we re go to have three peopl our next guest on the program thi even that will be some specialist in that area that you re speak and i ll certainli pass that on to them and we can discuss it later you all care to comment ani comment you might have the presid i d just like to sai if i might on thing i want to reemphas thi and i don t think i m be as clear about it as i d like although i think at least on of the peopl who will be on the second panel will be abl to sai it more explicitli than i i think thi whole concept of appli academ is veri import and i think that we have to basic abolish what i consid to be a veri artifici distinct between what is vocat learn and what is academ learn i think we should keep the liber art go i think we should have a strong compon for peopl who ar in the vocat program secretari reich it seem to me that we also need to rethink our entir track system becaus a lot of these school and work combin ar import for mainstream student thei re import for all student it s not just a special group of student that need them some of the experi that i ve seen around the unit state dick i m sure you ve seen them as well ar mainstream experi thei re mainstream all the student at th and th grade thei re give them a combin work and school experi and then a transit program and again the kid can either go on to colleg if thei want thei can go on to technic commun thei can go on to an entir a larg varieti of possibl and career direct but we have to get awai from the stigmat that often goe on with young peopl who simpli ar do job relat or work relat work within the classroom within our school secretari rilei thank you veri much i think that s go to be the last call that we have time for mr presid i think you ve got to move on to anoth matter and i want to thank you and secretari reich for be here we appreci your time and your idea and it s been a tremend help to us end p m edt
