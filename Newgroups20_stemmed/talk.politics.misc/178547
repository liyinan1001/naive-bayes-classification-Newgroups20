subject clinton am press brief by dee dee myer the white hous offic of the press secretari for immedi releas april press brief by dee dee myer the brief room a m edt q why wa the a m postpon ms myer just due to schedul conflict so as we put out the presid will meet with the leader of the nation polic organ at p m in the rose garden as oppos to a m the onli other thing on hi schedul todai ar at a m he ll meet with gener vessei who as you know is on hi wai to vietnam to continu work on the mia pow issu at p m he ll have lunch with the vice presid in the oval offic and at p m he ll meet with the polic organ then from p m to p m he ll do hi weekli photo with the variou group q a photo op with vessei ms myer there s no coverag on the vessei meet q why ms myer why it s a close meet q what about the lunch ms myer the lunch no there s no coverag q is he meet with ani congress peopl todai ms myer noth schedul q there ar no meet ms myer there ar no congression meet todai no q ha the presid been given ani inform by the pentagon or reach ani conclus about the valid of thi report from hanoi ani instruct to vessei on how to deal with the vietnames on that subject ms myer well clearli the report is the first order of busi it s high on the agenda on someth that thei ll discuss i think the presid and gener vessei will discuss the paramet of hi visit to vietnam todai but the presid hasn t drawn ani conclus about the report yet certainli it s someth that he want gener vessei to talk with the vietnames about first q did the presid talk with ani republican senat yesterdai about the stimulu packag ms myer he spoke with senat dole q how mani time ms myer i believ onc dure the dai and onc last night q what wa the outcom of that ms myer thei re continu to work toward some kind of an agreement on a job packag q is it your impress that senat dole is in ani wai flexibl on thi ms myer well i think we re hope that we re go to get some kind of job packag through the senat and we ll continu to work with senat dole and other until we reach some kind of an agreement q did thei discuss the vat tax ms myer i don t know if that came up q can you check that ms myer sure q so what ar thei is the presid offer to scale down hi program is that what he s try to do bui it down to where dole will sign on ms myer well he s try to protect as much of it as he can but it s import to him to get some kind of a job packag through the senat and through congress now and as soon as we reach some conclus on that we ll let you know but at the moment he s continu to consult with member of congress includ obvious senat dole q is he talk to anybodi els ms myer i don t believ he talk to ani other republican yesterdai q is he talk to anybodi todai ms myer i don t think anyth is schedul but i wouldn t rule it out q we were led to believ that the presid call mr dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the convers around to stimulu packag is that correct ms myer i think the presid ha contact sever peopl on russian aid i think that it wa alwai expect that the stimulu packag or the job packag will be part of ani convers he would have with senat dole the primari object of the convers wa russian aid that wa the first order of busi but it wa both q in the presid s mind ar thei link polit in that if the republican continu to reject the stimulu packag he think it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american peopl ha he made that argument ms myer i can t talk about specif what argument he might have made the presid is obvious commit to both he like to see a job packag to the american peopl first but as you know we outlin the detail of addit russian aid last night in tokyo q but doe the presid believ that the stimulu packag will make it more difficult to persuad american to vote for russian to accept a vote for russian aid ms myer i think that the presid is go to continu to work to pass the stimulu packag to pass a job packag and we re still hope that we ll get some kind of job packag through the congress q is it fair to sai that the presid is negoti now with dole ms myer he s discuss option with him q on the stimulu is it your understand that over the break some democrat themselv have left the support that thei had earlier for the packag the stimulu packag ms myer i think we still have wide support in the senat for the job packag q but specif that you ve lost democrat other than shelbi ms myer i don t believ so there hasn t been a vote q what about kohl q kohl and feingold ms myer there hasn t been a vote yet and we ll continu to work with senat to try to get a major to try to bring the packag to a vote becaus we believ that a major of the member of the unit state senat support the packag q if you re weren t worri about kohl and feingold why did georg mention milwauke project the other dai ms myer i think georg point out a number of project in a number of state that stand to be fund or to lose fund if thi job packag doesn t pass q no democrat laughter ms myer i ll let you draw your own conclus q doe he plan to talk to dole again todai or ani other republican again todai ms myer there s noth specif schedul but again i wouldn t rule it out q doe he plan to put out ani more press releas to ani other state todai ms myer what we ve done is we re in the process of break down the benefit of the job packag state by state i think it s entir feasibl that as we sort of ar abl to sum those up we ll send out press releas to the variou state that suggest how their state would benefit from thi packag q will you share those with us ms myer sure as we did yesterdai q do you have copi of the on you sent ms myer ye we made those avail yesterdai and we certainli can continu to provid them todai q dee dee sinc yesterdai s question and subsequ stori about the vat what further consider of thi issu ha been given ms myer noth s chang sinc yesterdai i think the presid comment on it thi morn to sai onli that it wa someth he knew wa be consid by the task forc and that he ha not made a decis on and i don t think we have anyth to add to that q but he also said that busi and labor group ar tell him thei support it can you tell us ms myer i think that there ha been i m not go to specul on who support it i think the presid said that there ha been some support among busi and labor group i don t think he said he wa directli contact by them q ar we to take that to mean that the administr ha sound out busi and labor group on thi ms myer i think there s been plenti of public discours on thi over the year and even recent but i don t think i want to add to that q in februari though the presid said that thi wa someth to be consid or year down the road what ha happen between then and now to caus thi administr to chang it mind ms myer i think as we said yesterdai it is someth that the work group ar look at thei re consid a wide varieti of option on everyth from fund to specif option that will be cover by the presid s health care plan the presid ha not taken it up yet ha not made a decis on it and beyond that i don t have anyth to add q you haven t answer the question it wasn t be consid by anyon in the white hous after the presid s comment in februari and georg reaffirm that in a brief q and then suddenli q what happen ms myer the work group as we have said throughout we instruct to consid a wide varieti of option across the board and on of the thing that ha been talk about and that thei ar clearli consid is some kind of a valu ad tax q but the presid himself took thi off the tabl dee dee and suddenli it reappear and thi goe to the credibl of thi administr in a wai what ha happen in the meantim ms myer the presid ha not look at thi it hasn t been present to him again yet the work group ar look at it as thei re look at a wide varieti of option and no decis have been made q and it rais the question of how independ the task forc is work ms myer the task forc wa instruct to consid all option and thei ve taken that mandat serious and thei re consid all option q but that s not the impress that the presid left in februari the impress he left wa that thi wa someth that wa long rang to be look at year down the road the clear implic of hi remark wa that thi wa someth that wa not on the tabl not an option q if it chang i ll tell you q bring him on q and you repeatedli refer to the presid s remark tell us that those were still in oper ms myer it s chang and we told you laughter q but that s what alic rivlin s comment and donna shalala comment were about i mean that seem like an orchestr effort becaus you have two independ cabinet offic ms myer i wouldn t no alic rivlin s not a cabinet member first of all second of all it wa not orchestr but clearli thei both said yesterdai and in the last coupl of dai that it s someth that s be look at we confirm that yesterdai and i don t have anyth to add to that q is it becaus he ha veri few option q is thi someth that it will be incumb upon the task forc to convinc the presid about in other word ha the presid himself person rule it out and it s now up to the task forc to convinc him to put it back on the tabl or is it in fact back on the tabl have been place there by discuss with the presid ms myer it is not the work group s mission at thi point to convinc the presid of anyth it is their mission to put befor him hi option and to explain the benefit and the cost and the basic pro and con of each of those option i think that thei will certainli present the vat to him in that context and at thi point he s not that present ha not been made but it s someth that he will hear and he ha not made a decis on q thei will present it to him as on of hi option though he specif rule it out ms myer correct q dee dee is thi more than a trial balloon is thi a seriou consider that the work group ar give to thi form of taxat ms myer it s simpli a statement of fact the work group ar consid a wide varieti of option on a number of issu relat to health care reform on of the option that thei re look at is the vat q dee dee when the work group were examin thi possibl wa thi on the tabl dure the same time period that you were tell us that it wa not ms myer i don t know what the specif time of their draft of option is i don t know q who wa tell you that it wa not under consider ms myer i wa refer back to the presid s comment q have thei discov that the sin tax won t rais enough monei to fund the core benefit packag ms myer no there s no decis that have been made on how to pai for the health care plan q i m ask whether the project ms myer there s a number of option depend on how the plan is structur you can t decid how much the plan is go to cost until you decid what the plan is go to look like and so you can t discuss what financ option have been rule in our out until you know q dee dee we ve been told that thei have a comput model on a number of possibl packag ms myer correct q the question is whether thei have now determin whether sin tax would not produc enough monei for even the barest minimum packag that is not a veri difficult comput ms myer it is a question that you know that we re not go to answer until there s a number of option be consid it depend on how the packag is structur the exact detail of the packag and the financ mechan us to pai for them ar all among the decis that have yet to be made q and when the presid ha been meet with health care hi health care advisor which we ar told he ha been do ms myer correct q thei have never onc said to him these ar your fund option includ the vat he ha never heard the word vat in hi ms myer i am not go to comment on the specif natur of the daili thei re not daili but the quasi regular brief q well you have ms myer i have not other than to sai that he s not consid the vat and i think that is a true statement q no but you said that it ha not been present to him as an option ms myer correct q that doesn t mean he hasn t heard about it ms myer i m not go to get into the detail of what s discuss i think that statement stand for itself q specif dee dee when you sai he hasn t look at it do you mean that he hasn t look at it in term of pai for medic coverag or hasn t look at it in gener becaus back in chilicoth he wa veri specif in defin how it work what the advantag ar the whole thing it sound like ms myer but that wa i think in chilicoth if you go back to hi remark there it wa a broader philosoph discuss of the tax structur and i think the comment were gener in refer to the overal econom plan but clearli it s someth that he s thought about in the broad context i mean that wa clear in chilicoth what i m sai is that in the process of the work group it s someth that he hasn t consid yet it s someth that the work group will present to him among the number of option and that no decis have been made and i m not go to comment ani further on the detail of the meet where health care issu ar be discuss q it s your statement from thi podium that no discuss of thi ha taken place you sai that no option that the option ha not been present to him ms myer that is correct q do you stand by doe the white hous still stand by georg s statement in march that thi will not be in the propos ms myer no decis have been made we have noth to add to what s alreadi been said q let me follow up here do you stand by what rivlin said yesterdai that if ani kind of vat were to be us or consid that other chang to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regress ms myer i m not go to comment ani further on what might happen if q but do you stand by the previou convers in februari that if there were to be a vat i think the presid said you d exclud food and energi ms myer i m not go to comment on the specif structur of a decis that hasn t been made q wa the presid awar prior to donna shalala s comment yesterdai that thi wa under consider by the work group ms myer i don t know specif what q could you check for us becaus that s a real import credibl question ms myer sure q sinc the task forc wa brought togeth thi issu ha been discuss at the begin and throughout as on fairli painless wai to rais a lot of monei were you all kept in the dark wa the press offic kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you ve been deni that a vat tax would be consid that it wa actual on the tabl over there as an option ms myer i think we ve said all that we have to sai it is someth the work group ar look at the presid ha not made a decis about it yet and beyond that i have noth to add q well sorri dee dee there ar still a coupl of question that we ar go to have to ask becaus we have a problem with credibl here your primarili what we re ask is if you all were not told at all that thi thing wa be consid while you were come out here and tell us that it wa not or if it s a case that you were come out here and deliber mislead us ms myer i don t believ that anyon ha ever come out here and deliber misl you from thi podium ever ever q ha anyon tri to shade it a littl bit to indic someth ha anybodi told anybodi to come out ms myer we re not try to shade answer or deliber mislead anybodi i ve said what i have to sai about thi issu q all we were try to find out ms myer i understand what you re try to find out and i ve given you the answer helen q we re try to find out what chang what made it an option again that s the ms myer the work group were given a broad mandat to investig all option and thei ar do that q ye but it wasn t an option befor how can you investig it if the presid ha taken it off the tabl ms myer it is someth that thei re obvious consid and the presid ha not made a decis on q ye but he took it off the tabl in februari ms myer work group ar consid it thei ll present it to the presid at some point and he ll make a decis q why would thei consid it if he ha taken it off the tabl ms myer it s clearli on the tabl q ye but he took it off the tabl did he chang hi mind ms myer it s back on the tabl bill q did he chang hi mind ms myer he said thi morn that he hasn t made a decis about it he obvious know that it s on the tabl it s someth that he will look at at some and when we have a decis on thi we ll let you know q so he must have chang hi mind right ms myer at some point it will be look at i mean q dee dee there s like two option either he chang hi mind or the work group think thei re author exce the presid s ms myer the work group were given a broad mandat to look at all option thei ve done that q ar you go to put out hi incom tax ms myer ye there will be someth avail on hi incom tax probabl later thi afternoon hi return will be avail q will there be ani kind of brief to go through it ms myer no noth s plan i think someon will be avail probabl not in a brief set but to walk you through the question q we re us to be walk line by line through the presidenti tax form ms myer i ve seen those brief laughter q could we have on ms myer no i don t think there will be ani kind of a formal brief but there will be somebodi avail to answer your question about it q did thei file a joint form ms myer ye q when did he file it ms myer i believ it s be file

agreement we will consid addit option which we ve been sai regularli q on follow up question then we cannot get a straight answer from anyon in the administr why do you not set a deadlin for the serb can you tell us the strateg or tactic reason for not give them a deadlin to come to the tabl ms myer we re continu to put pressur on them everi dai q which doesn t work so ms myer well we think it is
