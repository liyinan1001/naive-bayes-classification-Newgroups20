trademark of audio book inc a texa corpor which origin produc thi tape record reproduc under open licens grant by audio book inc thi is the dr beter audio letter r k st nw washington dc hello my friend thi is dr beter todai is april and thi is my audio letter r no it s now been almost on month sinc war broke out in the south atlant on the surfac it seem that it s onli a disput between argentina and great britain over the barren wind swept falkland island and south georgia island in realiti it s far more than that the so call falkland crisi is just the visibl tip of a giant militari oper dure thi month of april fierc naval battl have taken place not onli in the south atlant but also in the south pacif up to now most of the hostil have been kept under wrap by wartim censorship on all side but as i sai these word the naval war in the southern hemispher is about to come to the surfac begin todai april a total naval and air blockad of the falkland by the royal navi ha begun at the same time a counterblockad ha been declar by argentina in the same area to be effect a blockad must be impos over a period of time but the royal navi doe not have that much time winter is come on in the south atlant and the british suppli line ar overextend have come thi far her majesti s navi cannot simpli drop the blockad and sail awai in a few week time without draw blood from argentina as a result the british will be forc to undertak militari oper veri soon no matter how riski thei mai be there is also anoth reason why the royal navi now ha no choic but to engag the argentin forc in combat that reason my friend is that the royal navi ha alreadi suffer loss in secret combat thi month up to thi moment there will be no wai to explain awai the damag which ha been sustain by the british fleet onli when publicli admit fight erupt will the british dare to admit that thei have suffer battl loss to obtain that cover stori the british have no choic but to sail into combat but in do so thei will be risk even heavier loss on top of those alreadi sustain in short my friend her majesti s navi ha sail into a trap the event now unfold in the south atlant carri strang iron echo of the past for week now we ve been hear countless comment refer to the british task forc as an armada quot the british of all peopl ought to be veri uneasi with that descript the origin spanish armada year ago wa renown as a seemingli invinc fight forc but it came to grief in a naval disast so complet that it chang the cours of histori and it wa none other than the english navi that destroi the spanish armada the origin spanish armada put to sea in dure the reign of england s queen elizabeth i the armada wa an invas fleet carri thousand of crack fight men to invad england thei were met by the dare sea dog of sir franci drake drake and hi small fast ship turn the tabl on the spanish armada by chang the rule of battl the english fleet wa equip with new longer rang gun and it stai upwind and out of reach from there the english pound smash and shatter the big ship of the mighti armada when it wa all over bare half the spanish fleet wa left to limp back to port drake s defeat of the spanish armada wa a shock to the world it open the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start it expans into a truli global empir todai year later histori seem to have come full circl queen elizabeth ii is wit the dismantl of the world empir whose heydai began under queen elizabeth i and now the cultur of england and of spain ar onc again in confront onc again a so call armada is prepar for invas but thi time the armada is british not spanish four hundr year ago sir franci drake wa the hero of the dai todai the ghost of franci drake is onc again on the scene the south atlant war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passag around the southern tip of south america the defeat of the spanish armada four centuri ago broke the back of spain s naval supremaci and now the defeat of the new british armada mai well break the back of what remain of the onc gloriou royal navi my three special topic for thi audio letter ar topic the militari secret of south georgia island topic the secret naval war of the southern hemispher topic the rockefel fear campaign against nuclear war topic when the falkland island crisi began earli thi month it look at first like a tempest in a teapot for a centuri and a half sinc the island have been control by great britain dure that entir time british sovereignti over the falkland ha been disput by argentina there have been countless threat by argentina to seiz the island which it call the malvina but the threat have alwai come to noth in the past and britain ha never even gotten veri worri about them the island ar four time as distant from argentina as cuba is from the unit state and thei ar not much of a prize after year of occup the falkland ar home to fewer than british settler and a lot of sheep in short the remot falkland island hardli look like someth to fight over and yet here we ar watch anoth crisi take place we ar watch as war erupt between great britain and argentina the thatcher govern is act as if it ha forgotten all about it usual preoccup with the soviet threat at nato s doorstep instead britain is throw almost everyth it s got at argentina aircraft carrier cruiser destroy submarin assault ship you name it luxuri cruis ship have even been commiss and turn into troop carrier overnight wave after wave of addit assault troop have been activ and sent to join the fleet even after it sail ship and submarin have been pull off station from normal nato duti and sent to reinforc the task forc the initi ship forc ha grown steadili over the past sever week into an armada number over over two third of the entir royal navi ha alreadi been deploi to the south atlant off argentina watch all thi a lot of peopl ar ask what s thi fight realli all about the most popular answer suggest in the major media is oil vast deposit of oil ar known to exist under the continent shelf between argentina and the falkland but that ha been known for nearli year in no wai doe it explain the time of the sudden militari offens by argentina thi month and oil explain even less about the argentin seizur of south georgia island south georgia island is mile east of the falkland with no known oil deposit anywher near it and compar to south georgia the falkland ar an island paradis south georgia island is cover with rug mountain treacher vallei glacier and semi perman snow most of it is uninhabit on top of all that argentina ha absolut no legal or histor claim to south georgia island in that respect it stand in sharp contrast to the falkland in the earli s the falkland were occupi for a while by argentin colonist in the british expel them and took over the island for that and other histor reason argentina argu that the falkland realli belong to argentina not britain but no such argument is possibl for south georgia island it ha alwai been control by britain never by argentina or spain the argentin seizur of south georgia island look even more unreason from a militari point of view argentina s leader ar militari men and thei think in militari term thei were well awar ahead of time that far off south georgia island could not possibl be held for long by seiz it thei were set themselv up to absorb a militari defeat as the island wa retaken by britain so the question is why did argentina s militari junta bother with the seemingli worthless south georgia island at all my friend the answer to all these question ar militari not polit or econom south georgia island possess an enorm militari secret it s a giant underground instal buri under the mountain at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the so call falkland crisi is thi secret instal togeth with two other similar instal which i will describ shortli the secret militari complex have been in exist for mani year thei ar not new what is new is the acceler nuclear war timet of the american bolshevik war planner here in washington for the past two month i ve been report the detail of thi new war plan to you as quickli as i can obtain and verifi them the plan call for nuclear war on to erupt by septemb of thi year it is thi fast approach nuclear war threat that caus the so call falkland crisi to erupt now what is go on now is a coordin effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategi for the come nuclear war the mutual enemi of the american bolshevik here name the rockefel cartel and russia s new ruler in the kremlin ar behind the present crisi thei ar try to ruin phase of the project z war plan which i reveal last month that phase is to be world domin by the american bolshevik after both russia and the unit state have been destroi in nuclear war on as i mention last month the kei to thi plan is the exist of secret weapon stockpil in variou place around the world the american bolshevik militari planner here in america ar work with other bolshevik agent in kei militari posit of other countri to set off war have done that thei intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust thei have caus safe and cozi in govern war bunker when the war nation final lie smolder and exhaust the bolshevik will leav the shatter remain of their host countri thei will rendezv at the secret weapon instal and bring their weapon into the open thei will confront the world with the onli remain fresh up to date power militari forc on earth and us that militari power thei will becom the undisput ruler of the world that is thei plan to do all thi and thei plan to pave the wai for world domin veri soon by set off nuclear war on in a matter of month the rockefel cartel and russia s new anti bolshevik ruler ar work togeth in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mention that the bolshevik here ar benefit from war prepar which were start by the rockefel long ago it ha onli been about three year sinc the rockefel were dislodg as the prime mover of the unit state govern by the bolshevik sinc that time the unit state govern ha been a hous divid torn by intern power struggl between rival bolshevik and rockefel faction but befor that the unit state had been domin for decad both econom and polit by the four rockefel brother in the brother launch a new long rang plan for world domin it wa a two prong strategi half visibl and half secret which i first describ long ago in audio letter no it wa a plan for the unit state to arm to the teeth in secret while appear to disarm gradual without repeat all the detail the basic idea wa grandios yet simpl by deliber appear weak the rockefel control unit state would maneuv itself into a nuclear war with russia then the secret weapon includ superweapon would be unleash to smash russia and take over the world when thei set the grand plan in motion in the rockefel brother were look ahead to a nuclear war by the late s their militari analyst conclud veri earli that the war be plan would have veri differ effect on the northern and southern hemispher both superpow the unit state and the soviet union ar locat well up in the northern hemispher so ar the other full fledg nuclear power great britain franc red china and india by contrast the strateg target for nuclear war in the southern hemispher ar rel few and far between in other word it wa expect that the come nuclear war would be essenti a northern hemispher war in an all out nuclear holocaust it is known that seriou radioact fallout will gradual spread to affect even area not initi hit by war but there ar limit to how far the war cloud can spread it wa discov long ago that there is veri littl mix between the air of the northern and southern hemispher in the northern half of our planet cold air from the north pole work it wai southward toward the equat then it work it wai back to the north as warm air a mirror imag of thi process take up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemispher air meet in the equatori zone but veri littl of the air chang place the militari conclus my friend is thi the come nuclear war could ruin larg area of the northern hemispher for gener to come but if the calcul ar right the southern hemispher could escap virtual unaffect by the war thi wa music to the ear of the four rockefel brother a quick look at the globe of the world show why the rockefel cartel ha domin latin america ever sinc world war ii as i discuss in my veri first monthli audio letter nelson rockefel solidifi the cartel grip on latin america dure the war he accomplish thi as so call coordin of hemispher defens for then presid franklin d roosevelt so that take care of the south american contin and it natur resourc then there is the african contin there too rockefel control wa alreadi in effect over wide area of black africa especi south of the equat all thi wa thank to the effort of john d rockefel iii as i detail in audio letter no look around the globe the most import remain land mass from the standpoint of world domin ar australia and new zealand thank to world war ii both were wide open to the rockefel the rockefel brother decid to establish secret militari instal in the southern hemispher for us after the come war by thi mean thei expect to becom the master of the surviv southern half of planet earth after the northern hemispher war then as the northern hemispher gradual recov from the nuclear holocaust the rockefel empir would be abl to pick up the piec in thi wai the third gener rockefel brother expect their famili dynasti to inherit the earth in order to control the southern hemispher militarili after the war some mean would have to be avail to project militari power onto ani land mass for exampl revolt against rockefel domin would requir troop not a blast from the beam weapon on the moon the most critic factor for postwar militari domin of the world wa found to be a navi a minimum of two secret naval fleet would be requir on base in the south atlant the other in the south pacif sinc the reserv naval fleet were to be kept secret until after the northern hemispher nuclear war thei could not be built in exist shipyard new construct facil had to be built and thei had to be hidden to hide an entir shipyard is no small task thei take up a lot of space on top of that it wa essenti that the ship remain hidden after thei were built the best wai to achiev that wa to combin the shipyard and naval base into on over all secret instal final the secret naval instal had to be invulner to nuclear attack otherwis if it exist were ever discov prematur the secret navi might be wipe out the combin requir for secreci space and protect against attack were formid but on dai in while all these plan were still in the earli stage of develop the answer present itself dure a so call bank trip to sweden david rockefel wa given a tour of a uniqu hidden naval port the port is hollow out from solid granit cliff which come right down to the water the entranc to the port is a gigant hole in the side of the cliff which can be seal off with enorm steel door insid thi big doorwai on the water a huge caviti ha been hollow out to accommod ship the rockefel brother and their militari advis decid that a bigger more secret better protect version of the swedish hidden port wa just what thei want a survei of candid site wa then initi the site survei cover coastal area throughout the southern hemispher mani area were reject veri quickli becaus the topographi wa wrong other area were reject becaus thei were too close to the equat still other had to be rule out becaus there were too mani peopl live nearbi make the desir level of secreci imposs final it wa essenti that the site chosen for the secret naval instal be total secur polit at last the site for the secret naval instal were select in the south pacif extrem southern new zealand wa select thi is what i wa allud to in audio letter no three month ago when i call attent to new zealand s extrem import in the come war in order to obtain the necessari space the secret new zealand naval instal had to be divid up into two site locat close togeth on is at the extrem southwest tip of south island where the mountain rang known as the southern alp come down virtual to the water s edg the other part of the instal is built into the northwest tip of stewart island which is off the tip of south island the stewart island facil is hollow out within a rise known as mt anglem the new zealand locat met all the requir ever sinc world war ii the govern of new zealand ha been ti even closer to the unit state than to great britain the locat is far from the equat and the instal ar buri deep under mountain protect from nuclear attack thei ar also too deep to be reach by particl beam attack and the new zealand site is well situat to command the entir south pacif in the south atlant an even more perfect site wa found that site my friend is south georgia island it is locat perfectli for naval domin of the entir south atlant the tall rug mountain provid a perfect locat for the secret instal at the northwest tip of the mile long island it is control by great britain whose govern like that of new zealand wa will to cooper and south georgia island wa virtual uninhabit except for a whale station on the northeast coast the whale station wa some mile awai from the secret new instal which wa be built but britain took no chanc in the whale station wa close down sinc that time there have been no inhabit on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleg antarct scientist construct of the secret naval facil two in new zealand on on south georgia island began in the earli s the techniqu were adapt from those us previous to build other larg underground facil such as the norad instal insid cheyenn mountain colorado howev these techniqu were adapt in radic new wai to achiev construct access directli from the sea instead of overland in thi wai the shelter mountain wa left undisturb in appear both dure and after construct the cut in the mountain side which were necessari to let ship in and out were kept as small as possibl and were well camouflag like the swedish hidden naval port arrang the entranc to the secret instal can be seal up when seal the entranc is virtual imposs to detect unless you know exactli where it is and unlik most larg construct project there ar no tail or pile of leftov rock ly around to attract attent the man made cavern which hous the secret naval instal ar enorm but all the rock and debri wa dispos of at sea onc the secret naval facil were built thei had to be outfit for ship construct and docksit storag the fake disarma of the unit state dure the s contribut greatli to thi task from to on man plai a pivot role in thi elabor rockefel scheme he wa then secretari of defens robert mcnamara all through the s mcnamara presid over the public pare back of america s visibl militari power thi includ the close down and dismantl of entir shipyard what we were not told wa where all that shipyard equip went afterward where it went my friend wa to the new secret instal which were be outfit in new zealand and south georgia island the secret naval instal have been us as duplic facil to reproduc certain ship and submarin design and built here in the unit state as defens secretari caspar weinberg told congress recent it is cheaper to build two ship at a time that is especi true if the second ship is an exact duplic of the first thi ha becom even more true in recent year through the us of computer manufactur techniqu the secret naval fleet which have been built at the secret instal ar made up of duplic exact duplic of certain other ship and submarin thei ar all nuclear power nuclear sub nuclear cruiser nuclear destroy and ye nuclear aircraft carrier three of them a secret twin wa built for the u s s nimitz for the u s s eisenhow and for the newli launch u s s carl vincent all have been financ through the gigant cost overrun so call that we constantli hear about in the defens depart and all three carrier have been provid with a full complement of aircraft whose manufactur wa financ the same wai the ship of the secret american bolshevik naval fleet ar all duplic of other nuclear power vessel even so the secret naval ship possess on kei differ last month i reveal that the so call stealth program ha succeed in develop a kind of electromagnet invis shield thi techniqu make an object invis from a distanc by distort light wave in it vicin a whole new fleet of phantom war plane ar now go into crash product that us thi principl and my friend all of the secret american bolshevik navi ship have alreadi been outfit with similar stealth field equip the stealth principl is actual easier to appli to ship than to airplan becaus there is more room for the power equip that gener the field after nuclear war on the secret stealth navi of the american bolshevik would be light year ahead of ani other navi left on earth it would be perfect for the intend role of world domin the rockefel set it all in motion long ago my friend but three year ago thei lost control of the unit state militari now it s the american bolshevik who ar in control and thei ar bent on war these secret naval instal have precipit what is be call the falkland crisi topic in audio letter r no last month i describ project z the new bolshevik three phase strategi for nuclear war on an elit group of american bolshevik militari planner here ar flush out the plan right now at a secret war room here in washington it s a plan by which the unit state will strike the first nuclear blow follow by all out thermonuclear war with russia have set off the holocaust the bolshevik here and in certain other countri plan to rise it out safe in comfort war bunker final after nuclear war on fizzl out in stalem thei plan to leav behind the ash of the unit state and her alli activ phase of their grand strategi thei plan to unveil their secret weapon especi their secret naval fleet with these thei plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world the unit state as we know it will be dead and gone but in the ey of the bolshevik themselv thi outcom will constitut victori up to now the nuclear war timet which i first reveal two month ago is still on track thei ar still shoot for nuclear war to begin by septemb of thi year time is fast run out the bolshevik here ar sprint as fast as thei can toward war but my friend the bolshevik ar not the onli runner in thi race thei have two deadli enemi both of whom ar equal determin to trip up the bolshevik on enemi of the bolshevik here is the rockefel cartel the other enemi is the new anti bolshevik rule cliqu in russia and now these two mutual enemi of the bolshevik ar pool their effort in certain wai in audio letter no three month ago i report that a limit new anti bolshevik coalit wa in the work between the rockefel cartel and the russian the januari meet between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland wa a turn point in the format of thi coalit it is now a realiti and is respons for the so call falkland crisi now domin the headlin it should be emphas that thi new relationship between the rockefel cartel and russia fall far short of a true allianc thei have veri major disput to be settl between them but for the time be thei have call a truce between themselv to deal with their mutual deadli enemi the bolshevik here in america the first prioriti of the russian and the rockefel is to slow down the bolshevik prepar for immin nuclear war if thei can do that time is on the side of the rockefel cartel in certain polit movement which i discuss last summer in audio letter no a slow down in the nuclear war timet will also give more breath space for addit anti bolshevik action to be implement the joint rockefel russian planner decid by mid februari that militari action against the bolshevik wa essenti veri quickli no other type of action had ani hope of take effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of thi summer the exact detail of the project z war plan ar not known to either the rockefel or the russian but the gener outlin ar known to be as i describ last month it wa decid that militari action should be devis that would undermin phase of the bolshevik war plan that is the bolshevik control secret naval instal and fleet in the southern hemispher should be attack and crippl by work togeth the rockefel cartel and the russian were abl to devis an attack plan which neither could have carri out alon the rockefel group who built and origin control these base provid detail intellig about the best wai to attack them the russian with their enorm militari machin provid the muscl to actual carri out the attack it wa essenti to devis a scheme that would enabl both secret fleet in the south atlant and south pacif to be attack surviv intact of either fleet would leav the bolshevik war plan still workabl militari analyst conclud veri quickli that a direct assault on the new zealand facil wa out of the question there wa no combin of commando frogmen or other militari forc which could possibl keep an attack secret from the outsid world ani attack on the new zealand base would set off the veri war which the rockefel and russian want to prevent but the situat in the south atlant wa a differ matter in a wai the greatest asset of south georgia island wa also it achil heel the extrem isol which protect the secreci of the south georgia base also made a covert militari assault feasibl the kei lai with argentina and her long stand claim to the falkland island as i mention in topic the rockefel cartel ha domin all of latin america for decad cartel oper were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the govern militari junta there the histor disput over the falkland island wa to be us to provid a ruse a militari cover to enabl the south georgia base to be attack the argentin gener were not told everyth about the situat by ani mean but thei were told enough to make clear what thei were to do as an induc to cooper the argentin leader were promis handsom reward thei were guarante that after the shoot wa over the falkland island would remain in argentin hand thi guarante includ the promis of covert militari assist as need against the royal navi and to bolster the troubl argentin economi it wa promis that the rockefel cartel will help develop the immens offshor oil reserv with these combin promis of militari glori and financi reward the argentin militari junta agre to the plan on march argentina carri out act in the joint attack plan a group of argentin scrap metal merchant of all thing land at the abandon old whale station on south georgia island supposedli thei were there to dismantl the old build and cart them off to sell while thei were at it thei also rais the argentin flag over the work site the british alwai nervou about south georgia island promptli react as expect the british antarct survei ship endur put marin ashor thei drove off the scrap merchant and tore down the argentin flag the incid provid the desir excus for the argentin junta to bring the simmer year old falkland disput to a boil from time to time in the past argentina ha claim that south georgia is part of the falkland becaus it is administ that wai by britain that argument is veri flimsi but it now came in veri handi it wa noth new to hear thi from argentin leader so there wa no hint of what wa realli afoot dure late march argentin militari forc start assembl for an assault on the falkland noth new thought the british high command argentina ha carri out threaten maneuv in the past mani time it wa believ that thei were about to do it again but on april argentin forc did the unexpect after mani past fals alarm thi time thei actual invad and seiz the island all argentin public statement emphas the long stand histor claim to the falkland themselv but just for good measur the next dai a small argentin forc also seiz far off south georgia island the forc wa so small that it gave the appear initi that it wa just a side show from argentina s point of view howev the small conting of royal marin were overpow and bundl off the island along with a group of alleg scientist that wa the moment of payoff in the joint rockefel russian attack plan thank to the elabor distract stage by the argentin forc a special commando team got onto the island undetect base on the detail rockefel inform about the base the team move to a locat on the mountain directli abov the cavern secret base special high speed drill equip wa set up by the rockefel member of the team while the russian member concentr on militari defens by late that even april the militari high command in london final learn what wa realli take place the secret south georgia base wa under attack by virtual the onli mean possibl the joint rockefel russian team were drill a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollow out cavern insid it wa onli a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceil of the giant hidden naval base onc the hole wa made the next step wa obviou the rockefel russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole the best guess wa that it would be a nerv ga the shock wave that went through the highest level of the british govern on the even of april can hardli be describ my friend the thatcher govern like the so call reagan administr here in america is bolshevik control that s why margaret thatcher alwai sai me too ani time the reagan administr sai or doe anyth against russia both govern ar parti to the secret nuclear war plan in complet betray of the peopl of their respect countri and on the even of april thei suddenli discov that their preciou war plan wa in deep deep troubl immedi the thatcher govern start assembl a naval armada to sail for the south atlant hast wa the order of the dai the drill on south georgia island wa proceed around the clock the best estim were that the drill would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three week on or about april if help did not reach south georgia by then the secret instal might be doom the forc station at the instal itself were unabl to defend themselv under the circumst their mighti naval ship were ship in a bottl thei did not dare open the bottl to sail out to fight becaus the russian commando were arm with tactic and nuclear weapon to open the blast proof entranc door would be suicid on april just two dai after south georgia island wa seiz some naval ship began move out of british port the same dai lord carrington wa sack as foreign minist he wa forc to resign my friend becaus he had assist the rockefel attack plan by downplai the argentin attack prepar that same dai april new zealand the home of the other secret naval fleet broke diplomat relat with argentina the two hidden new zealand facil had been place on red alert as a precautionari measur all submarin at the twin base were order to sea sever surfac ship were alreadi at sea undergo sea trial but that still left seven major ship insid the hidden twin naval base includ on of the nuclear aircraft carrier i mention earlier on that busi dai of april argentina s foreign minist costa mendez wa at the unit nation in new york he wa alarm by the deploy of such a larg part of the royal navi costa mendez hurri here to washington to seek reassur from certain offici he got them for the next two week or so the new wa fill with stori about the allegedli slow movement of the british fleet while negoti went on that my friend wa onli a cover stori the royal navi wa actual join up and move as rapidli as possibl toward south georgia island if the task forc arriv in time to save the secret base a major battl wa like the offici stori about slow movement of the british armada were intend to give a cushion of time for that battl if need be the fleet would have sever dai to retak south georgia island then it could move on to arriv near the falkland on the announc schedul in thi wai the crucial import of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserv it wa initi expect that advanc element of the british fleet would reach the vicin of south georgia island within two week that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefel russian commando team and stop the drill befor it wa complet but russian cosmospher and submarin made a shambl of the plan kei advanc element of the south georgia attack conting left ascens island earli april two dai befor it wa announc offici shortli after thei did so thei ran into troubl russian cosmospher and attack submarin close in on a singl ship which wa critic to the plan counterassault on south georgia island the cosmospher bombard the bridg and combat inform center of the ship with neutron radiat in moment the ship wa without ani command it commun and radar silenc then a russian sub close in and quickli finish off thi kei british ship with torpedo it broke apart with secondari explos and sank rapidli so far as is known there were no survivor thi unexpect shock in the mid atlant produc two result both import first it caus a slowdown in the race toward the south atlant by the british armada the task forc had to be regroup into a configur better suit for an enrout defens but that cost valuabl time public announc from london about the progress of the fleet reflect thi slowdown the timet for arriv on battl station near the falkland start stretch out longer and longer all thi bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island the drill continu the other result of the sink wa equal import word wa flash to the south pacif stealth navi to prepar for possibl action it wa obviou that the russian navi wa get involv in the atlant which meant that the royal navi could be in big troubl dure the dead of night earli april the seven stealth ship put to sea from their twin secret base in southern new zealand thei deploi to a secret oper headquart area in the antipod island mile southeast of new zealand their electromagnet shield were oper to provid protect from attack these shield make it imposs to commun with the outsid world or even to see it as i explain last month but onc thei arriv at the antipod the stealth ship hook up to buoi equip with shield commun cabl to the island headquart the antipod headquart in turn wa in constant touch with the south georgia base by wai of a transocean cabl around the tip of south america the deploy of the avail ship of the south pacif stealth fleet wa exactli what the joint rockefel russian planner had hope for the ship had been flush out from their essenti invulner hide place in new zealand the british ship s sink of april wa also follow by other event on april the argentin navi start move out of port the same dai alexand haig arriv again in bueno air supposedli he wa there as a diplomat but in realiti he wa there as a gener deal with gener haig is the top government oper of the rockefel cartel as i have reveal in the past he wa make sure that the argentin did not get cold feet and back down at that critic moment four dai later april haig left for washington as he board hi plane haig somberli told report time is run out and so it wa my friend for the secret south georgia base the veri next dai april the drill broke through into the hollow out cavern of the naval base bolshevik militari analyst in london had not expect that it could be complet until at least the follow weekend the british fleet wa still out of rang the weapon which the commando team insert down through the long hole wa a small compact russian neutron bomb when it wa deton insid the confin of the huge artifici cave the effect were devast the intens radiat instantli kill everyon insid the base also the heat and blast effect of the bomb ar believ to have damag all the ship insid suffici to badli disabl them meanwhil russian cosmospher and submarin were converg on the stealth ship which were near the antipod island await order from a distanc the ship were invis
