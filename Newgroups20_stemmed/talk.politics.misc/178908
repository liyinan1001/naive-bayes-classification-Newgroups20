the american peopl i want to express my appreci to the attornei gener to the justic depart and to the feder agent on the front line who did the best job thei could under deepli difficult circumst again i want to sai as i did yesterdai i am veri sorri for the loss of life which occur at the begin and at the end of thi tragedi in waco i hope veri much that other who will be tempt to join cult and to becom involv with peopl like david koresh will be deter by the horribl scene thei have seen over the last seven week and i hope veri much that the difficult situat which feder agent confront there and which thei will be doubtless requir to confront in other context in the futur will be somewhat better handl and better understood becaus of what ha been learn now q mr presid can you first of all tell us why after dai you decid q mr presid can you describ for us what it is that janet reno outlin to you in your minut phone convers with the presid i can t hear you both if on will go first and then the other q sorri can you describ what janet reno q mr presid the presid i ll answer both your question but i can t do it at onc q can you describ what she told you on sundai about the natur of the oper and how much detail you knew about it the presid ye i wa told by the attornei gener that the fbi strongli felt that the time had come to take anoth step in try to dislodg the peopl in the compound and she describ gener what the oper would be that thei want to go in and us tear ga which had been test not to caus perman damag to adult or to children but which would make it veri difficult for peopl to stai insid the build and it wa hope that the tear ga would permit them to come outsid i wa further told that under no circumst would our peopl fire ani shot at them even if fire upon thei were go to shoot the tear ga from armor vehicl which would protect them and there would be no exchang of fire in fact as you know an aw lot of shot were fire by the cult member at the feder offici there were no shot come back from the govern side i ask a number of question the first question i ask is why now we have wait seven week why now the reason i wa given were the follow number on that there wa a limit to how long the feder author could maintain with their limit resourc the qualiti and intens of coverag by expert there thei might be need in other part of the countri number two that the peopl who had review thi had never seen a case quit like thi on befor and thei were convinc that no progress had been made recent and no progress wa go to be made through the normal mean of get koresh and the other cult member to come out number three that the danger of their do someth to themselv or to other wa like to increas not decreas with the passag of time and number four that thei had reason to believ that the children who were still insid the compound were be abus significantli as well as be forc to live in unsanitari and unsaf condit so for those reason thei want to move at that time the second question i ask the attornei gener is whether thei had given consider to all of the thing that could go wrong and evalu them against what might happen that wa good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those work with them were convinc that the chanc of bad thing happen would onli increas with the passag of time the third question i ask wa ha the militari been consult as soon as the initi tragedi came to light in waco that s the first thing i ask to be done becaus it wa obviou that thi wa not a typic law enforc situat militari peopl were then brought in help to analyz the situat and some of the problem that were present by it and so i ask if the militari had been consult the attornei gener said that thei had and that thei were in basic agreement that there wa onli on minor tactic differ of opinion between the fbi and the militari someth that both side thought wa not of overwhelm signific have ask those question and gotten those answer i said that if she thought it wa the right thing to do that she should proce and that i would support it and i stand by that todai q mr presid the presid wait go ahead q can you address the widespread percept report wide televis radio and newspap that you were try somehow to distanc yourself from thi disast the presid no i m bewild by it the onli reason i made no public statement yesterdai let me sai the onli reason i made no public statement yesterdai is that i had noth to add to what wa be said and i liter did not know until rather late in the dai whether anybodi wa still aliv other than those who had been actual seen and taken to the hospit or taken into custodi it wa pure and simpli a question of wait for event to unfold there wa i have i can t account for why peopl specul on wai or the other but i talk to the attornei gener on the dai befor the action took place i talk to her yesterdai i call her again late last night after she appear on the larri king show and i talk to her again thi morn a presid it is not possibl for a presid to distanc himself from thing that happen when the feder govern is in control i will sai thi howev i wa frankli surpris would be a mild word to sai that anyon that would suggest that the attornei gener should resign becaus some religi fanat murder themselv applaus i regret what happen but it is not possibl in thi life to control the behavior of other in everi circumst these peopl kill four feder offici in the line of duti thei were heavili arm thei fire on feder offici yesterdai repeatedli and thei were never fire back on we did everyth we could to avoid the loss of life thei made the decis to immol themselv and i regret it terribl and i feel aw about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when and i talk to her on sundai i said now i want you to tell me onc more why you believ not why thei believ why you believ we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it s becaus of the children thei have evid that those children ar still be abus and that thei re in increasingli unsaf condit and that thei don t think it will get ani easier with time with the passag of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think thing stand q can we assum then that you don t think thi wa mishandl in view of the outcom that you didn t run out of patienc and if you had it to do over again would you realli decid that wai the presid no well i think what you can assum is just exactli what i announc todai thi is a the fbi ha done a lot of thing right for thi countri over a long period of time thi is the same fbi that found the peopl that bomb the world trade center in licketi split record time we want an inquiri to analyz the step along the wai is there someth els we should have known is there some other question thei should have ask is there some other question i should have ask can i sai for sure that no on that we could have done noth els to make the outcom come differ i don t know that that s why i want the inquiri and that s why i would like to make sure that we have some independ law enforc peopl not polit peopl but total non polit outsid expert who can bring to bear the best evid we have there is unfortun a rise in thi sort of fanatic all across the world and we mai have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anyth we can do particularli when there ar children involv but i do think it is import to recogn that the wrong doer in thi case were the peopl who kill other and then kill themselv q mr presid were there ani other option present to you for resolv thi situat at ani point from februari th until yesterdai the presid well ye i got regular report all along the wai there were lot of other option pursu if you go back you all cover it veri well the fbi you did a veri good job of it i mean the fbi and the other author there pursu ani number of other option all along the wai and a lot of them earli on seem to be work some of the children got out some of the other peopl left there wa a at on point there seem to be some line of commun open up between koresh and the author and then he would sai thing and not do them and thing just began to spin downward whether there were other in term of what happen yesterdai the convers i had with the attornei gener did not involv other option except whether we should take more time with the present strategi we were pursu becaus thei said thei want to do thi becaus thei thought thi wa the best wai to get peopl out of the compound quickli befor thei could kill themselv that s what thei thought q did the govern know that the children did not have ga mask q congression hear onc the situat ar you in agreement with that the presid that s up to the congress thei can do whatev thei want but i think it s veri import that the treasuri and justic depart launch thi investig and bring in some outsid expert and as i said in my statement if ani congression committe want to look into it we will fulli cooper there is noth to hide here thi wa probabl the most well cover oper of it kind in the histori of the countri go ahead sarah q there ar two question i want to ask you the first is i think that thei knew veri well that the children did not have ga mask while the adult did so the children had no chanc becaus thi ga wa veri she said it wa not lethal but it wa veri danger to the children and thei could not have surviv without ga mask and on februari th let s go back didn t those peopl have a right to practic their religion the presid thei were not just practic their religion thei were the treasuri depart believ that thei had violat feder law ani number of them q what feder law the presid let me go back and answer i can t answer the question about the ga mask except to tell you that the whole purpos of us the tear ga wa that it had been test thei were convinc that it wouldn t kill either a child or an adult but it would forc anybodi that breath it to run outsid and on of the thing that i ve heard i don t want to get into the detail of thi becaus i don t know but on of the thing that thei were specul about todai wa that the wind wa blow so fast that the window might have been open and some of the ga might have escap and that mai be why it didn t have the desir effect thei also knew sarah that there wa an underground compound a bu buri underground where the children could be sent and thei were i think thei were hope veri much that if the children were not releas immedi outsid that the human thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplac where thei could be protect in term of the ga mask themselv i learn yesterdai i did not ask thi fact question befor that the ga wa suppos to stai activ in the compound longer than the ga mask themselv were to work so that it wa thought that even if thei all had ga mask that eventu the ga would forc them out in a nonviol nonshoot circumst ms myer last question q mr presid why ar you still sai that q could you tell us whether or not you ever ask janet reno about the possibl of a mass suicid and when you learn about the actual fire and explos what went through your mind dure those horrend moment the presid what i ask janet reno is if thei had consid all the wors thing that could happen and she said and of cours the whole issu of suicid had been rais in the public he had that had been debat anywai and she said that the peopl who were most knowledg about these kind of issu conclud that there wa no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next dai or the dai after that or at anytim in the futur that wa the judgment thei made whether thei were right or wrong of cours we will never know what happen when i saw the fire when i saw the build burn i wa sick i felt terribl and my immedi concern wa whether the children had gotten out and whether thei were escap or whether thei were insid try to burn themselv up that s the first thing i want to know thank you q mr presid why ar you still sai it wa a janet reno decis isn t it in the end your decis the presid well what i m sai is that i didn t have a four or five hour detail brief from the fbi i didn t go over everi strateg part of it it is a decis for which i take respons i m the presid of the unit state and i sign off on the gener decis and give her the author to make the last call when i talk to her on sundai some time had elaps she might have made a decis to chang her mind i said if you decid to go forward with thi tomorrow i will support you and i do support her she is not ultim respons to the american peopl i am but i think she ha conduct her duti in an appropri fashion and she ha dealt with thi situat i think as well as she could have thank you applaus end p m edt
