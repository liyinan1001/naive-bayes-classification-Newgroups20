subject drug and crime a new approach wa re if drug should be legal wdstarr athena mit edu william decemb starr write in articl apr msuvx memst edu kebarn msuvx memst edu said i m for creat a class of noncommerci drug which would includ the current illeg on which would be legal to possess grow produc but not to sell bomb the pusher back to the barter ag and tax product too um why what s wrong with the act of sell recreat drug even for mercenari reason e g get rich note by sell i mean sell the product to a consent adult at a mutual agreeabl price i point thi out in an effort to pre emptiv prevent thi thread from get sidetrack onto a flamefest about push drug to schoolchildren or the like and why should the user be subject to special taxat william decemb starr note thi is a repost of my earlier respons to mr starr which wa not properli format apolog to those who ve seen the follow befor to explain my posit on the war on drug i offer thi drug and crime a new approach by ken barn given that the trade in illeg drug is respons for much of the crime which afflict our nation peopl who want drug particularli peopl who ar predispos to addict will find a wai to get them whether or not thei ar legal avail despit current law enforc effort drug ar readili avail to those who want them addict to drug both legal and illeg is respons for a signific drain on the product resourc of our countri and thi occur in a varieti of wai from the cocain addict babi who ar unabl to learn to the spread of diseas among addict to the tragic consequ of alcohol abus and tobacco smoke a gener econom principl of govern is that whatev is subsid you get more of and whatev is tax you get less of to be most effect in confront the nation s drug problem some wai must be found to util these addit power of govern to make drug deal and drug us less attract while thi countri s current effort to combat legal drug have succeed in some respect there is a greater awar of the health consequ of smoke and design driver program have help reduc drunk drive for exampl the same cannot be said for the war on illeg drug there remain a core group of illeg drug user which support intern network of smuggler pusher grower processor kingpin and gangster these network and their market activ which includ drive by shoot corrupt law enforc author and smuggl weapon ar directli or indirectli respons for a larg proport of the crime commit in our countri everi dai clearli illeg drug and rise crime ar link it take onli a moment s reflect to recogn how thei ar link the link is monei as with thi countri s fail effort to prohibit alcohol consumpt a black market ha been creat in which greedi local monopoli like the gangster of a bygon era have profit enorm from their illeg trade the victim of thi trade includ not onli the innoc peopl unfortun enough to be caught in the crossfir but i would argu the drug user themselv were it not for the black market and the violent monopoli of the drug lord drug user might not be the thiev robber prostitut and murder thei have becom in order to pai the high price the drug lord demand in the absenc of the drug lord most would be i believ simpli peopl with a problem either a moral problem or a medic problem but not a crimin problem let me be clear howev i am not advoc that we let the crimin who have been prei on our societi for these mani year of prohibit off the hook on the contrari the new approach i advoc is on which would not result in either the govern or privat industri get into the busi of promot crack cocain or ani other present illeg drug for that matter neither is it an approach which see law abid citizen hand over more and more of their freedom and privaci in an effort to track down illeg drug user until the land of the free and the home of the brave look like a polic state here then is my propos possess and us of all present illeg drug is decrimin but bui and sell them remain illeg pothead can grow their own marijuana as mani alreadi do todai other drug user can legal import their poison of choic as long as thei pai the tariff and a barter economi of drug experiment develop becaus of the barter economi which suppli the drug user the black market profit that have so enrich the drug lord dwindl if these drug can be obtain for free or next to noth why bui them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommerci drug even at rel low price therefor law enforc activ is concentr on those individu who continu to bui and sell and also on the crime commit by drug user too poor to afford even low price but here is where the strategi begin to differenti between the drug dealer the victim and the drug user their victim upon arrest for ani crime suspect ar permit to choos whether or not thei will undergo a drug test those who choos to cooper ar inform that upon convict for the crime thei ar accus of if thei ar found to be a drug user thei will be institution until thei ar clean and onli then will thei begin to serv their sentenc if thei choos to cooper and ar alreadi drug free thei can begin to serv their sentenc right awai those who choos not to undergo the drug test and ar convict face stiffer fine and serv longer sentenc institution of drug us crimin serv sever purpos drug us crimin and thi includ drunk and or stone driver ar separ from their sourc of suppli thu reduc the total number of drug user in societi at larg and consequ decreas the demand for drug on the street put more of the remain drug dealer out of busi institution provid an incent for drug us crimin to straighten themselv out befor becom part of the gener prison popul while help protect societi from crime institution could also serv to deter drug user from becom crimin sinc drug us crimin unlik other crimin would be delai prior to serv their sentenc by the addit time it take for them to sober up institution of drug us crimin separ from the gener prison popul would also provid a close monitor pool of addict who could volunt for research studi of new techniqu and treatment for addict diseas with the potenti to benefit both themselv and other dealer in illeg drug ar gener not drug user themselv and thi is particularli true of the drug boss or kingpin run larg illicit organ under thi propos dealer would be more readili identifi sinc upon arrest thei would presum pass the drug test or els declin to take it in order to avoid have to explain why thei ar in possess of drug when it is appar thei do not us them declin to take the test thei would of cours face stiffer penalti while each case of attempt sale of a noncommerci drug would have to stand on own it merit the outcom of a suspect s drug test could provid addit evid for the prosecut just as cigarett tax have contribut to the declin of smoke in our countri by make cigarett more costli while at the same time provid revenu for anti smoke campaign noncommerci drug should be tax and the monei gener should be us to combat their us enforc of thi tax should be on a voluntari basi howev and should not be us as an excus to infring on the right and privaci of noncommerci drug user sinc to do so would have the effect of reintroduc prohibit instead drug user will be encourag to pai the tax by remind them that if untax drug ar ever found in their possess dure the cours of routin polic oper thei will be requir to pai the tax immedi or els forfeit their untax drug to be destroi if drug dealer ar found to be sell noncommerci drug on which tax have not been paid thei will face addit prosecut for evad the tax the strategi of ad tax evas to drug deal charg is alreadi in us in some jurisdict but it effect is current limit by the illeg of drug possess revenu from drug possess tax and import tariff would be us to fund anti drug advertis campaign and provid support to privat sector drug treatment program for those unabl to afford treatment taxpay subsidi to all drug produc must be end feder support of tobacco farm is both immor and wast in thi era of tight budget and the marijuana crop grown illicitli on feder land in mani state must likewis be elimin while my propos would have the effect of permit the us of what ar now illeg drug it would hold the user of all drug respons for their action and i believ would reduc the harm drug have on our societi particularli the crime caus by the illeg drug trade so long as we remain a free nation with rel porou border and freedom for our citizen to travel we will alwai have a drug problem whether it take the form of heroin addict dy in abandon build drunk driver kill and maim other on our street or emphysema patient struggl for breath after a lifetim of smoke the result ar the same needless suffer and death as a societi we must recogn that while our societi permit us to harm ourselv with drug as we ar alreadi do regardless of the drug law we must take a stand against the harm that drug and drug user caus to other we must particularli oppos the viciou and violent cartel which prei on the weak of drug user by take the profit out of their deadli trade my propos goe a long wai toward shut down these power crimin organ the question of whether drug us is a moral or medic problem depend on which group of drug user you re talk about differ drug have differ effect and some ar more addict than other the addict of a drug also often vari between individu and so we have some peopl who can drink alcohol in moder while other find thei cannot resist the bottl nicotin which former surgeon gener c everett koop declar to be as addict as heroin is a legal drug with known harm effect and while some peopl can stop smoke by willpow alon other continu to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer for those individu who can stop take drug on their own we mai argu that becaus thei have chosen to us them thi repres a moral failur on their part or an unwilling to face the difficulti of life but for the addict while thei mai have chosen to us drug the first time by the time thei discov their addict it is too late we cannot hold them respons for their diseas ani more than we would blame someon who is drown for an inabl to swim perhap thei should have known not to go near the water or perhap someon should have warn them of the danger but in their present circumst warn will not help neither doe it help for the drug dealer on the shore to be toss them weight standard disclaim x dna
