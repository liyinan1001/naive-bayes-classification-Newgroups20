a m pst folk we re about to start the background brief on the aid packag senior administr offici good morn the presid presid clinton and presid yeltsin agre yesterdai on a seri of american initi to support econom and polit reform in russia and it s valu at billion befor take your question and run through the basic outlin of thi packag i want to make a few point first thi is the maximum that the clinton administr can do with avail fund to support russian reform all of the fund have been alloc and appropri by the congress there is no need for the administr to go back to the congress to fund ani of these program all our fiscal year fund current ar avail so in effect all of these program can begin tomorrow the second point is that thi packag is design to support russian reform all of the initi in the packag ar direct at reform and for their benefit and all have been work out with prior consult with the russian govern third the presid is determin that we will deliv on these commit thi year the packag is design to maxim our abil to support reform in design it we want to avoid make commit that we could not meet and we feel veri confid that we can meet all of these commit in front of you fourth i d like to note the special import of trade and invest i think it s fair to sai that russia s capit and technolog need throughout the next decad extend well into the hundr of billion of dollar no collect of govern can meet those need onli the privat sector can do so and so the presid and presid yeltsin agre to make trade and invest a major prioriti in the relationship thei also agre that there would be a new joint commiss on energi and space form head on the u s side by vice presid gore on the russian side by prime minist chernomyrdin and the goal of thi effort is to break through the barrier to trade and invest on both side and to promot a vastli expand relationship if it would be help i d be prepar to run down the first page which is a summari of u s assist and just give you some gener background on what these program ar i ll do it quickli and then i ll be glad to take question the first group of initi ar humanitarian food and medic assist thi is part of our effort which ha been underwai for sever year to provid basic humanitarian grant food assist so that the russian govern can assur there s at least a minim amount of bread on the shelv in the major citi that s million in grant that is from food for progress the grant portion of food for progress we ll also be continu our grant assist in medicin and pharmaceut suppli and that s million the second item is concession food sale as you know the unit state ha had a long term grain relationship with russia it s import to us and it s import to russia that we continu that relationship the presid ha chosen the food for progress program which is a concession loan program the valu over the next seven month is million these ar concession term the exact term have not been work out but i think it s fair to sai there will be a grace period on princip of six or seven year and concession rate thereaft for the life of the deal the third program is a collect of privat sector support we think thi is on of the most import thing we re go to do privat and the creation of small busi is the number on prioriti of the reform govern in moscow and so the presid ha decid to creat a russian american enterpris fund capit thi year at million and the goal of thi fund is to make direct loan to small busi in russia to take equiti posit in those busi the presid ha also decid to creat a privat fund which would work directli with the russian govern in it prioriti object of try to convert state enterpris from a state own basi to a privat basi he ha also agre the presid ha also agre to establish a eurasia foundat thi would be a privat foundat led by promin american to fund democrat project in russia the fourth group you see there in the summari page is democrat itself i think it s fair to sai that thi administr ha given a new impetu to the goal of pursu democrat in russia you see that we have a total of million in program variou program the detail tabl give an indic of some of the program that we re launch the presid is also call for the develop of a democraci corp which will be an overarch umbrella group to try to incorpor all of the dispar privat and public effort now underwai from the unit state to support reform in russia the fifth program you see is russian offic of resettl thi is a new initi creat and conceptu by thi administr thi is a demonstr project what we d like to do is work with the russian militari to help resettl russian offic return from the baltic state and other part of the former soviet union we want to make sure that we work out the best wai to do that whether it s with russian labor and russian materi or us prefab american construct and so we ve decid to fund on a demonstr basi the construct of hous unit we ll be work veri close with the russian militari on thi and i would sai that we have a long term commit to thi project the sixth area is energi in the environ thei ar two issu that the presid feel strongli about our initi effort will be feasibl studi to look into the possibl of enhanc their energi product both oil and ga and equal import try to cut down on the leakag in the oil and ga pipelin system which caus so much environment damag i ve talk a littl bit about trade and invest about the new group be creat that the vice presid will chair on our side secretari ron brown will also be cochair with deputi prime minist shohkin a busi develop committe which will work in all other sector of the economi to break down the mani barrier that current exist and imped trade and invest we ar also go to appoint a full time invest ombudsman in the american govern to work on thi problem full time and the point i d like to make here is trade and invest in the s is everi bit as import to draw an analog as arm reduct wa in the s and s and we just thought that in look at thi we need to make a commit within our own govern to have peopl work on it senior peopl on a full time basi becaus it is terribl import you ll notic that the unit state is go to support russia s membership in the gatt russia ha had observ statu russia ha request our support and in fact request our advic in becom a member of the gatt we think that the long term goal of draw russia into the global economi is paramount a veri import goal and that is why we ar support the membership in the gatt we ar also support their access to gsp the gener system of prefer you ll note that ex im ha extend million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia that opic ha extend million in credit and loan guarante for a conoco oil project i d like to emphas that we ar veri close to an agreement between russia and the unit state for a billion framework facil through the ex im bank that would financ russian purchas of american oil and ga equip and servic we think thi is a veri import develop we think we ll get there by april th which is the open dai of the tokyo confer the g confer befor i take ani further question i d like to defer to my colleagu who will review the secur assist object with you senior administr offici our major unfinish agenda with the russian and with their counterpart in ukrain kazakhstan and belaru is in the area of the safe and secur dismantl of the nuclear arsen on their territori under the term of the start i and start ii agreement recent we complet in moscow three i think veri import agreement that devot a signific chunk of nunn lugar fund to three import program the first is the program of million for the strateg nuclear deliveri vehicl dismantl program that is for submarin for icbm dismantl and for bomber dismantl million the second is a million tranch of fund for the construct of a facil to store nuclear materi remov from the warhead as thei ar dismantl thi will essenti contribut to the overal design and the earli phase of the construct of that storag facil and final a million tranch of monei to help in the establish of a monitor system for the nuclear materi as thei ar withdrawn from the weapon system so we add that million total to the extant nunn lugar assist which ha been flow about million for some overal safeti improv for variou kind of equip and safeti measur that we have been work out with the russian over the last coupl of year so thi is an area where we will be go a lot more work with not onli the russian but with the ukrainian kazhak and belarussian belaru for exampl ha just in the last coupl of week receiv up to million in fy fund for safeti secur and dismantl program on belarussian territori and thi wa in the wake of their ratif of start i an agreement to acced to npt so we ar work veri hard with all the parti to the lisbon protocol and will continu to work veri hard with them and i look upon these three recent agreement with russia as a veri import step in that process q the opic fund to is that for the field in kazhakstan and conoco alreadi sign thi deal with kazhakstan why do you feel now it is necessari if it s the same on why do you feel it s necessari senior administr offici it s not the same deal chevron sign a deal with kazhakstan the teng oil field thi is a new invest project it s a polar light oil develop and renov project and it s be announc todai so it s complet new q can you tell us more about what s involv senior administr offici ye conoco like other american oil compani ha been search for wai to do two thing on to prospect for new oil in siberia west siberia and two to try to get into the busi of renov oil well and renov pipelin both oil and ga in russia the object here obvious is to take advantag of the natur resourc in russia increas energi product which will in turn increas hard currenc revenu which is what russia need so we think thi deal is veri veri good develop for russia the russian do as well and it s good for an american compani and the american govern ha plai a lead role in pull thi togeth through the credit facil in opic and through the loan guarante q so it s to search and also to renov field that ar alreadi there senior administr offici that s right q on that point should other american compani expect to get administr support for such deal or should thei now go to the ex im and try to get the monei out of the billion senior administr offici well as you know ex im is part of the u s govern and variou part of the u s govern have been push includ the state depart and the white hous for thi deal to be consumm and we think it will and if we arriv at thi agreement by april th there will be billion in financ avail for american compani to sell their equip and sell their servic q that should take up all of the rest of the deal and their won t be and their will or there won t be support for opic sort of deal such as thi conoco senior administr offici there s a tremend amount of interest on the part of american oil and ga compani to invest in russia we think that the ex im oil and ga facil the billion facil onc it is conclud will soak up a lot of that interest but i think the interest mai even extend beyond that and if so the govern will respond q what s the current year budget cost of that billion agreement should it go forward and is there ani current year budget cost senior administr offici i ll have to refer you to ex im for that i don t know the detail of that q the concession food sale is there ani current year cost to that or is it delai until the year in which the payment ar due senior administr offici the concession food sale ar from food for progress which is a usda program usda ha the fund we don t need to go back to the congress to expend those fund there will be a hit in the budget i d refer you to usda and omb for the detail on that q can you talk about the democraci corp q and the privat sector how mani folk ar go to be involv in that senior administr offici why don t i start with the democraci corp first i think the administr felt come into offic that there were liter thousand of organ privat organ in the unit state that in on wai or anoth were work at the goal of try to achiev democrat in russia help on a farmer to farmer basi and there were liter or u s govern agenc that had a varieti of program in thi area and so the administr felt the presid felt it wa import to try to draw all of these initi togeth under on group to give some coher to the effort and to give some impetu to the effort and so thi is a presidenti initi it will be head by ambassador tom simon who will soon take up hi duti as the coordin for u s assist in the former soviet union and we re veri hope that we might us thi democraci corp not onli to draw upon the resourc of our own govern but the resourc of the american privat sector and school and commun across the nation q ani kind of commit yet ani kind of word yet on fy and ani new monei that need to be appropri besid the million the presid talk about senior administr offici the administr is request addit fund in fy of million what the presid ha done thi weekend is to consult realli intens yesterdai with presid yeltsin about addit measur the unit state could take in some of these area to support reform he ll be consult with the congress when he return to washington he ll be consult also with the other alli govern and we ll make a decis at that time q two question about the billion agricultur monei first of all i thought it wa the sort of consensu that what russia did not need wa more loan for food so why did you decid to do it that wai secondli could you explain agricultur ha been stop from make further loan for food becaus of russia s inabl to pai how doe thi fit into that situat senior administr offici as you know the unit state for a long time ha been a major supplier of grain and food commod agricultur product to russia i think between and we had extend a littl bit of histori here about billion in credit credit guarante through the commod credit corpor that wa the princip vehicl to ensur the sale of american grain product on decemb of last year the russian govern stop it payment on that program thei ar now in arrear to us on that program and therefor by law the unit state cannot continu that program and so the presid work with secretari espi and other offici in the cabinet look for other wai that we could promot american grain sale and i think we have two wai to do that we ve announc todai million in grant food assist through the food for progress program but we do not have suffici author to spend million in grant food and so we look for a concession loan program i think everybodi agre that russia that a short term loan program for russia would not make sens now but a long term concession loan program would and that is what thi program is it will provid onc the final detail ar work out for a six to seven year grace period on payment of princip and then from year seven through which is the life of the deal it will provid for concession rate of interest gener around three to four percent and so we believ and the russian govern believ thi is a good deal for them becaus it will avoid the imper of earli payment and put them into the out year but it will also continu thi veri import grain relationship which is import for them and it s import for the american farm commun q i gather from what you sai that thi could make it explicit the russian failur to pai the interest on ecc loan doe not in ani wai affect thi kind of loan go through is that right senior administr offici let me be explicit about that we ar prevent under the law to from continu the commod credit corpor short term credit program becaus of russia s arrearag to the unit state all of you know about those arrearag thei total about i think around million usda can give you an exact figur so have taken that into consider and want to preserv american market share and a long term grain relationship want to respond to a specif request from the russian govern for major food assist know that we couldn t take it from the grant program becaus we don t have suffici author there we look at food for progress which is a program we ve us to great effect in other part of the world and we consult with the russian govern and arriv at thi solut i think the russian ar pleas becaus it provid them with the food but also give them a littl bit of relief on the short term payment q where do those fund actual come from senior administr offici thei come from the food for progress program which is a program under usda s author usda ha the author to spend these fund we do not need to go back to the congress for these fund and i want to make that gener point again everyth in thi packag the billion packag compris fund that have alreadi been alloc and appropri by the congress the administr can begin to spend these moni tomorrow and it s veri import in our ey that we expend all the fund thi year that we meet these commit and we ar confid we ll be abl to do so q how did you arriv at the figur of million doe that max out that program or did you actual have a rang from to senior administr offici there s a reason for it the reason wa that the russian govern told us that s about the amount of grain that thei need between now and harvest time and so the idea is that we would begin the shipment probabl million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time russia won t requir the same level of food import from the west q i would imagin there s go to be some consider envi and jealousi on the part of some of the other republ becaus of the size and the scope of thi with russia have you given ani consider to advanc negoti for the same kind of project with the ukrain with georgia with some of the other republ senior administr offici ye we re veri conscienc of the fact that we also have an interest in extend american support to the other countri of the former soviet union we have told ourselv and we have plan that in the area of technic assist the grant technic assist that you see roughli percent of the fund will go to russia and roughli percent to the other countri in the area of food sale we have been activ with ukrain in grant food assist with georgia and armenia we will continu that and i think it s fair to sai that after thi summit we will go back and look at all of our program with the other countri to ensur that thei ar adequ and thei ar product and thei re hard hit q ha anyth happen at the summit to lead american energi compani and other compani to believ that russia is go to be more user friendli toward them in term of tax legal bureaucraci senior administr offici well on of our primari object come into thi summit wa to highlight not onli the econom agenda but also trade and invest and i d like to refer to the point i made at the begin we re convinc in talk about thi problem the problem of how to support russia long term we re convinc that no collect of western govern have the financi resourc over the next decad to fuel the continu of reform that onli the privat sector can do that we look at our own societi and we see tremend capabl in resourc in the oil and ga sector it is a veri good match with what the russian need now which is financi invest in the exist oil and ga well and pipelin and new technolog and new capit to financ new product that s what the russian govern ha told us it want to do and so that s why we have made such a major emphasi on it that s why trade and invest wa a promin issu on the first dai of these talk and in fact figur promin last night in the meet between presid yeltsin and presid clinton and we re hope that togeth we might send a strong signal to the american busi commun that we support their effort to invest in russia that the unit state through ex im and opec and the depart of commerc will be there to support them q my question is is yeltsin in ani posit to deliv on make russia a more senior administr offici we think he is i would note that presid yeltsin s prime minist mr chernomyrdin work for year in the russian oil and ga sector he will now chair a high level commiss with the vice presid vice presid gore to try to break through the barrier that current exist to western invest in the oil and ga sector we believ we have a commit to make that committe an import committe and we re look forward to the work q what type of mechan is alreadi in place to administ the privat sector portion of the program and will the u s be directli involv in the tail end of distribut of the actual fund or is the monei simpli turn over to the russian govern for distribut at their will senior administr offici ar you talk about the varieti of program list here it depend on the program itself in most case though we ar either work through american pbo or american govern agenc to ensur that the monei obvious is well spent that the monei get to the intend sourc that s an oblig we have to the congress to ensur the monei is well spent and that we can account for the monei we have done that in the last coupl of month intens and we will continu to do it for each of these program but thei ar all quit differ for instanc in the area of grant food and medic assist for grant food it is carri out through usda and usda account for the deliveri of the food for grant medic assist we ve been work through project hope which is a privat organ for the hous for instanc the resettl of russian offic we ll be work with a group of american pbo on some of the democrat project we re work directli with russian privat individu and privat foundat we re work with journalist in russia on a media project that you mai have notic so we liter have here to differ activ under all these rubric and thei re all go to be carri out in slightli differ wai some directli with the russian govern some with russian citizen q the jackson vanik restrict that remain and on the cocom restrict that remain can you tell us what the presid ha to do on that senior administr offici well as georg note yesterdai presid yeltsin rais these as irrit in the relationship the presid ha note that i think it s fair to sai we will go back now in our own govern when we return to washington and look at both of these question and we ll get back to the russian govern q you were not prepar for these question when you got here senior administr offici we were prepar for these question we ve look at them but we re not prepar to make a quick decis thi weekend thei requir let me just explain particularli on jackson vanik thei requir consult with the congress thei requir consult with the american jewish commun and we re veri sensit to those concern and so we ll want to go back and talk to them befor we take ani action q is thi packag design so that you will not have to go to congress for anyth at thi point senior administr offici as i said at the begin the advantag of thi particular packag is that all the fund have been alloc and appropri by the congress so the administr will not have to go back to the congress to seek ani addit author to fund ani of these effort in effect thei can all begin tomorrow and i know that mani of the agenc respons for these project will begin tomorrow and that s the advantag of thi particular initi q if thi as the presid sai is a long term long haul thing and member of congress ar at thi moment head for moscow why aren t you talk about go to congress and suggest to the presid of russia that you ar prepar to go to congress for variou thing senior administr offici i think we ve been clear about that the presid is discuss thi weekend with presid yeltsin some addit idea that we have for american fund of addit project and idea that he ha we have a major congression deleg that left last night head by repres gephardt and we ll want to consult with that deleg and other member of congress befor do anyth and we ll also want to consult with our alli so that s where it stand now q we ve been told repeatedli that a number of these item repres differ or new wai of spend the monei alreadi appropri could you just tick off which of these item repres reprogram or at least spend monei in wai that it wa not previous set to be senior administr offici i think that we ve said that these ar all project that either congress had alloc monei for through the freedom support act there were some fund that were left over from fy and thi administr took offic and had some new idea about how the fund might be expend we didn t us just the freedom support act fund or the fy fund we went into some of the agenc alloc ex im opic and usda and tri to look for creativ wai to further our program and exampl of that is the food for progress concession loan we had hit a brick wall with anoth type of fund through usda we could not go forward legal and so we look for a more creativ wai to ensur continu american market share and ensur continu grain sale and we think we found it q where for exampl ar you get the monei for thi russian offic resettl senior administr offici that s from the freedom support act fund q in other word all of the monei is be directli spent in new wai so to speak senior administr offici most of the grant project that you see if you look at the gener chart the second chart it s broken down into grant and credit and if you look under grant the technic cooper project that total million that is almost all freedom support act fund a littl bit of it is leftov fund from fiscal year the nunn lugar fund of cours you know about the legisl histori of those fund q cooper senior administr offici from fy i don t have the exact figur it wa not a consider figur q could you tell us pleas ha anyth happen here thi weekend that will break the log jam between ukrain and russia over start for start i and ii as a result of what s happen here senior administr offici both presid presid yeltsin and presid clinton will be discuss thi issu thi morn in fact we haven t yet gotten to secur and arm control relat issu that will be thi morn s session i know that presid clinton will be veri strongli reinforc that thi is a top prioriti for us we ve been talk to the russian and the ukrainian over the last coupl of week about wai that we might help to facilit the discuss between them up to thi point thi ha been a veri import negoti that s been go on essenti between moscow and kiev and we ar at the point now of essenti discuss with them if there ar wai that we could contribut to thi discuss help to move thing forward essenti but in term of what is come out of thi weekend i don t yet know in a coupl hour we ll know q just a follow up on the financ here is ani of thi rob peter to pai bori sinc it s all current year appropri have you taken it from anyplac that s been earmark and put it into thi fund senior administr offici there ar smoke and mirror here and i think it s an import point to note we could have given you a page of assist number that includ out year fund we re go to make a long term commit to mani of these project for instanc the enterpris fund the privat effort the hous effort and we ve alreadi talk to the russian about our long term commit we could have put in realli big number and thi could have been a bigger packag but we want to make a point thi packag is fy it s fund that we have and we re go to do what we sai we re go to do and the presid feel veri strongli about that in the past there is a legaci that the western govern the combin of govern put up larg budget figur and for ani number of reason we re not abl to meet them we re determin and the presid is determin to carri out everi singl program in thi packag and we ll do it but we do have a longer term commit and that s part of the discuss on econom thi weekend we re look for russian idea on what it is we can do to most effect support reform and we ve told them that we do have a commit on some of these program beyond thi fiscal year q taken it wai from ani senior administr offici no we haven t okai the question is have we reprogram ani of these fund so have we taken it from other countri to pai for program in russia the answer is no we have not done so q in term of fund there is no avail moni left and you simpli find a creativ wai to find monei somewher els doesn t that in fact support the theori senior administr offici not at all i don t think it doe that s a particular exampl and the exampl is grain sale the commod credit corpor credit guarante program wa short term loan that russia had to pai back within to month you all know about russia s debt problem and russia wa unabl to meet those commit so we look for a wai to do two thing to meet russia s requir for grain thei re a net grain import on a massiv scale and also meet our object of make sure that the american farmer have a chanc to sell their product to russia and we simpli look for anoth wai to financ that and we have legisl author to do it thi program ha been success in other area we had not tri it befor in the former soviet union but we thought we should now q isn t thi realli the bush clinton aid packag for russia sinc these fund were realli first deriv by initi put forward by presid bush senior administr offici no i don t think that s a fair character a lot of these fund were appropri by the u s congress is in thi administr took offic and inherit some oblig that the bush administr had made but we had a long six to seven week review of thi program we decid to meet the commit that had been made by the previou administr but we have gone well beyond them in fund the enterpris fund which wa just an idea but the idea had not been fill out with a program there wa no number attach to it in group togeth some project and try to make them into a coher whole in the privat effort i would sai is anoth clinton initi further we listen to the russian govern and listen to the russian militari who told us that the resettl of their offic wa import to them for polit and econom and social reason and presid clinton ha respond to that and we ar make a long term commit that beyond thi demonstr project we re go to figur out a wai to do much more in try to settl those offic i would also sai that the presid ha given impetu to all of us in the agenc to think much more broadli about what it is we can do on democrat becaus there we have some experi and some compar advantag that lend itself to the russian experi and in call for the creation of a democraci corp which is anoth new initi we re hope that we can take the resourc of the privat sector as well as the american govern to achiev that object so i would not character it that wai at all and as most of you know i am a career civil servant i wa in the last administr i m veri familiar with what the last administr did and i would character thi as a clinton assist packag for russia q there s been a lot of critic that aid in the past ha not gotten to the peopl is there anyth in thi outsid of the ombudsman that will guarante that thi monei will not just disappear becaus it s be administ by the russian govern senior administr offici i think that i know that the presid and other senior offici of our govern ar concern that american monei be spent wise and that it get to the sourc that it s intend for which it s intend and so we re go to take great care aid and the state depart will take great care in make sure that the fund ar expend properli and that thei re reach their sourc i would not that thi packag is not simpli a packag of support sole to the russian govern some of these project especi in democrat and exchang ar go to be work out directli with russian privat individu with busi the privat enterpris support is anoth exampl of that senior administr offici if i could just add a word on thi point with regard to the ssd relat program on area that we ve been look at veri veri close is consider of actual us russian firm in subcontract for these kind of program thei would be work veri close of cours with the american firm who would be the prime contractor but thi is a fine exampl i think of a more of a imagin and flexibl approach toward get some of that fund down to the grassroot level down to the ground in russia but at the same time ensur that it is spent effici and for the purpos for which it wa intend q when would the democraci corp start exactli when do you see thi happen how would get it off the ground senior administr offici well the presid is todai call for the creation of a democraci corp i think it s fair to sai that we re go to work out it framework over the next coupl of week ambassador simon take up hi duti on mai st but in effect we ve alreadi start becaus over the last coupl of week the administr ha begun to reach out to peopl in the privat sector who have come to us ask us to help facilit their activ in russia and we ve said that we will be help we ve also tri to kind of coordin in a much more effect wai the activ of our own govern we do have or agenc that ar activ in russia in on wai or anoth we think it make sens to draw them togeth and to focu their effort q excus me how much of thi billion will actual be spent in the unit state by american made good senior administr offici i don t have ani figur for you now but perhap we could try to work someth up in the next coupl of dai on that q thi figur is larger than the figur that ha been in the press did thi program grow yesterdai as a result of the discuss or have we just been that far off the mark senior administr offici no i think unfortun the press ha been a littl bit off the mark and i m sorri to sai that no thi packag presid clinton put us to work about seven week ago on thi packag and he wa brief intens on thi he contribut a lot of the intellectu leadership in thi packag he contribut a lot of the idea in the packag and i think it s fair to sai that we had thi rough packag work out about two week ago we have been refin it ever sinc we spent a coupl of dai last week go over it with the russian govern both the embassi in washington and the govern in moscow through our own embassi and so it s been evolv but thi particular packag ha been togeth for about two week q where is yeltsin s input into thi then there wa so much talk befor about the presid want to get yeltsin s view about specif what wa need and so forth is that in the out year senior administr offici no it s both presid yeltsin ha on sever occas told us for instanc that support for the creation of privat busi is import to him that the resettl of russian militari offic is import and that first and foremost the effort to privat the state industri is import to them and so what we did wa to try to make those the centerpiec of our technic assist part o the packag we listen to him on the privat effort we have been work with the russian govern for month on thi try to work out all the detail so the russian govern on most of these program wa involv everi step of the wai but let me get at the other part of your question the presid is also us thi weekend to talk about a broader set of initi that we might undertak and we re look for hi idea the presid ha brought hi own idea to the tabl for instanc on energi and the environ and in hous but we re look for russian idea not we need to consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other alli govern that ar also activ q there s essenti noth that happen in the last dai and a half that measur alter the packag that you came in with senior administr offici thi particular packag as i said wa work out and wa readi about two week ago we have sinc then consult with the russian govern on the final stage of it develop and so thi weekend we ve primarili talk about futur about what more the unit state and other western countri can do to support reform in russia which is our base object here q i notic that you that monei appropri to train banker and businessmen and offic can you tell me what about job train for worker who ar displac by privat senior administr offici you re right we have a program to train russian young russian in bank and financi servic in the unit state part of the hous initi it s not just to build hous unit it s to retrain russian offic who ar retir into other profess q monei for job train for worker whose job ar disappear becaus of privat senior administr offici we have not yet alloc ani monei for that q why not q of the million is go to build hous unit isn t that a lot of monei per unit given what the western dollar will bui in the former soviet union senior administr offici if you want to do hous the right wai it s not just the build the framework of a hous you ve got to think about all the util you ve got to think about the purchas of land you ve got to think about sewag and ga and electr and so forth and it s also retrain it s not enough to put retir an offic come out of riga or tallin or vilniu in a hous in western russia we think we have an oblig to try to retrain those offic as well thi is respond to a request from the russian govern q of the million will go to retrain senior administr offici that s right q ar you talk about apart build or singl senior administr offici we re talk about singl individu dwell q you re sai that onli famili will be serv by thi senior administr offici what i want to i thought i point out earlier thi is a demonstr project what we didn t want to do given the experi that the german and the turk and the italian have had in build hous in western russian we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of monei what we want to do is work over the next coupl of month and try to figur out with american organ in the privat sector the best wai to get thi job done i note that we have a long term commit to that and so i would expect that we would put a lot more monei into thi in the futur but we want to do it wise we want to spend the monei wise q what is it about thi program that convinc you that it will protect russia s reform and that russia will be in a posit to mai back the monei thei re suppos to pai back especi consid their other debt problem senior administr offici well look i think it s import to note that the unit state on it own doe not have the capabl to fuel a continu of russian reform it s got to be a collect western effort and we re look to our alli to do more as well but beyond that it s realli what the russian do that is go to decid the fate of reform we can simpli plai a role and we feel we have an oblig to do so which is consist with our nation interest q did the presid sai that the valu of the u s contribut wa that it would creat secur and prosper for the unit state so what is it about thi program that doe thi senior administr offici i think you have to go back to the fundament object of our polici toward russia and that is we want to do everyth we can to support the continu of reform we ar convinc that if reform stai in power then we ll be abl to continu the drawdown of nuclear forc foreign polici cooper and econom interact which ar the three benefit to the unit state from reform in russia so it s not a simpl question you can t just sai that thi program is the answer it s a long term question and we have to make a long term commit to it q and then on the question of russia s abil to repai what convinc you thei ll be abl to pai seven to year from now senior administr offici well the russian govern ha made a commit to repai and what we re hope is that if reform continu and if thei can continu to improv their oil and ga sector and earn addit hard currenc revenu that russia will be in a posit six or seven year from now to pai back those loan q substanti govern to govern loan we ve ever gotten into with the russian senior administr offici i don t want to answer authorit on
