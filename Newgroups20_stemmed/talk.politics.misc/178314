that that wa not under consider q ye clinton sai it is not someth that is now under consider is that no longer true mr stephanopoulo i believ the work group as ms shalala sai ha look at thi prospect but no decis have been made of ani kind q well i know but he said he d tell us about it if it wa ever under consider i take it that now he is and he didn t tell us about it or mr stephanopoulo did he sai if it wa under consider or if it wa someth to be propos q if we start consid i ll tell you mr stephanopoulo if it s someth to be propos q if we start consid it i ll tell you that s a direct quot mr stephanopoulo the task forc ha look at a number of differ option thei have not made ani decis yet the presid ha not made ani decis yet thi is on of the propos under consider by the task forc wa to go out and cast as wide a net as possibl for differ idea on how to reform the health care system thei have cast a veri wide net thei have look at hundr of differ propos probabl thousand of differ propos but the presid ha not made ani decis q well is the presid awar of their consider of thi option mr stephanopoulo i don t know if he s been brief on ani preliminari conclus or anyth like that from the task forc on thi specif propos of ani kind i don t know that that s gotten to hi level he start yesterdai to go through with the task forc a veri wide rang of decis and i don t believ that that s been present to him no q well he s not reli on the usa todai to tell him what hi task forc is consid in the wai of tax mr stephanopoulo no he s go through it in a veri deliber fashion there ar a number of decis that have to be made i don t know that thi propos ha reach that decis make point q if thi is still under consider that s a chang at least from what we ve been told by dee dee i think about three week ago or so she said that is not an option talk about the had a big argument with somebodi over thi so i rememb it specif and said it not onc but twice is that not the case mr stephanopoulo again i don t know if thi ha been present to the presid as someth that is be look at at some level in the task forc q it wa rule it out though i mean unlik other option that you ve kept in the mix thi on specif wa rule out mr stephanopoulo again thi is someth that is be look at but no decis ha been made of ani kind i mean it doesn t it s not necessarili materi until you get to the decis make phase the work group ar look at hundr of differ option q if it wa rule out befor and it s not rule out now then someth ha chang georg ye no q when a gui sai in februari mr stephanopoulo well the work group ar look at the widest possibl rang of option q so someth s chang thei weren t look at it befor thei re look at it now mr stephanopoulo well i don t know if the work group have gotten to that point yet thei ar cast a veri wide net q how wa it possibl that you and dee dee were abl to sell definit rule it out as an option previous and now ar sai that in fact it is be consid mr stephanopoulo again the work group ar look at a wide rang of option thei have not q do you deni that you and dee dee rule it flatli rule it out on sever occas in the past month mr stephanopoulo i don t deni that i mean those ar the presid s word those ar veri clear q subsequ to the presid s word do you deni that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicli rule it out mr stephanopoulo i don t know about the time i think what we did wa refer back to the presid s word and sai thei stand q so don t thei stand ani longer q march th clinton said for the next four to five year it wa rule out mr stephanopoulo well those word the presid did sai that in februari the work group ar on a separ track and as i said i don t believ q separ from the presid mr stephanopoulo i don t believ thi ha been present to the presid q ar thei consid someth that the presid q ha rule out q ha rule out i mean will the presid consid a vat tax mr stephanopoulo again the work group have not present thi to the presid thei have look at a wide rang of option i suppos that if an argument is made he will clearli listen to it that doe not mean he ha decid to do it q can we put thi anoth wai in hi answer in ohio he look at the vat in term of restructur the whole tax system under those that wa the circumst that he said it might be consid at some futur point is that no longer the case or is that the onli wai that he can see a vat emerg mr stephanopoulo i guess i m not sure exactli what you re ask q he talk about the vat in the context of a restructur tax system not as a specif wai to financ health care for exampl q or anyth els q or anyth els q it wa alwai in the context of substitut for other tax at a time of a dramat overhaul of the whole tax system mr stephanopoulo right q ha that chang too q is that still hi view mr stephanopoulo i haven t spoken about those specif comment i think i can just go back to it ar the work group have thei examin the possibl of a vat ye thei have q certainli we re look at a vat she said mr stephanopoulo thei have examin the possibl of a vat ha it been present to the presid ha he made a decis no he ha not q what kind of a deal do you have when you ve got the presid s appoint task forc obvious not oblivi to hi rule someth out except in the context of some huge down the line reform goe ahead on it own and consid a tax which he ha specif rule out in ani context other than much later and then goe ahead and announc that that s what thei re look at is the presid concern about that sort of thing mr stephanopoulo i think that the presid s concern is to make sure he get the best health care propos possibl he s concern with make sure that thei have the most thorough process for examin all the possibl altern all the differ altern if a decis is made to go forward with someth like that it s certainli someth the presid will explain and justifi but no decis ha been made along those line q what doe it mean exactli though when the presid rule someth out doe it mean it can get back on the tabl later if a more persuas argument is made mr stephanopoulo that s just that s indisput true if you but at the same time he ha not rule it in he ha not made a propos q what make him open to it now when he wasn t open to it befor mr stephanopoulo he s certainli will to listen to the argument q wa he will to listen to the argument for a short term tax thi year and he wasn t will to listen to it in chilicoth he s now open to it mr stephanopoulo the context of hi comment wa that it wa not someth he want to be clear that thi is not someth he wa propos not someth he wa float q not someth he wa consid those ar hi word it s not someth that s now under consider if we start consid it i ll tell you you re now acknowledg ar you not that it is under consider and mr stephanopoulo i m acknowledg that the task forc ha studi thi propos i am also state that the presid ha not made a decis on it q but the door is open for the presid to reconsid includ thi as part of mr stephanopoulo obvious the work group ar look at it again but the presid ha not made a decis q do you know if thei will make a present on behalf of the vat to him mr stephanopoulo i don t know that i assum that if i don t know what stage thei ar it in propos i don t know that thei re go to make the conclus that thi is someth thei should present to him i know thi is someth the work group ar look at q do you understand georg that none of us ar ask these question in context of a decis that the presid ha made onli about what the presid is consid mr stephanopoulo i understand that and i am acknowledg that the work group have examin the issu of a vat q and the presid will consid it mr stephanopoulo i assum that he will consid the argument if it is present to him q doe that mean the presid that work group think that when the presid sai no he mean mayb laughter mr stephanopoulo i think that mean that the work group ar try to do the most thorough job possibl q georg can i ask you anoth question about bosnia mr stephanopoulo sure laughter q no he want us to stai on thi q let s do gai in the militari laughter q no he got out of that swamp q i think we ve gotten the bottom line on that vat reggi bartholomew your special ambassador in belgrad todai said that if the serb do not accept the agreement that ha been work out quot we will do our part to pursu the lift of the arm embargo togeth with our alli that seem to go a bit further than what you ve just said mr stephanopoulo sound almost exactli what i just said q well do you accept in other word you accept what reggi mr stephanopoulo well the presid ha said that thi is someth that s under consider it is someth he will consid if the current action don t bring the serb to the tabl q isn t there some kind of timet here mr stephanopoulo ye there is a timet there s go to be a vote on the u n resolut in about dai q that s on sanction that s on tighten the sanction mr stephanopoulo that s right that s sanction and we believ that that will ratchet up the pressur and we hope that that will bring the serb to the tabl as you know mr bartholomew also met with mr churkin of russia and thei ar also work on wai to bring the serb to the tabl we will continu to pressur them in mani differ wai and thi is on possibl option as well q the question is whether there s a timet for consider or a vote on a decis on lift the arm embargo not the sanction mr stephanopoulo the next vote in the u n is on sanction as far as i know there ar no vote schedul on lift the arm embargo but it is someth that we have discuss both intern and with our alli q why did reggi bartholomew tell the serb that the u s would do that what wa the point of hi tell them that mr stephanopoulo well clearli i mean thi is someth that s under consider and thi is someth that we take quit serious if thei do not come to the tabl thei should know the consequ of fail to come to the tabl q have thei been given a deadlin q warren christoph ha been sai the same thing and it hasn t seem to chang the serb behavior in the least why should the serb take ani heed of a threat to lift the arm embargo when so far everyth that s been done ha had no effect on the fight in bosnia mr stephanopoulo i just don t accept the premis of your question it ha had an effect the embargo is have an effect q what effect mr stephanopoulo if the serbian choos not to heed our warn then thei will face the consequ q what effect ha it had in bosnia mr stephanopoulo well the effect that it ha had on the serbian it ha tighten up thei ar not get their shipment through we can brief more fulli q in bosnia georg in bosnia what effect ha it had mr stephanopoulo well it s hard to sai if it s stop the aggress to date that is why we re continu to press for the serbian to stop but we believ that over time we will continu to weaken the serb and that will have an effect i m not sai it s go to happen overnight it clearli hasn t happen overnight but we believ that over time the sanction can weaken the serb if it fail to work and if the serb fail to come to the negoti tabl we ll move forward with the embargo q isn t there a work deadlin georg of the th the same date as the u n the schedul u n vote hasn t the unit state said along with mani of the other nato alli that if the serb aren t will to sign on to the peac accord by then that we ll seek haven t we said that we will seek mr stephanopoulo we ve said continu we re go to q but on that deadlin mr stephanopoulo i don t have a specif date but we re go to move forward with the resolut the u n resolut by around that time and if that fail to take effect if that fail to bring the serb to the tabl we will clearli consid other action q isn t thi awfulli increment mr stephanopoulo we re take a step by step approach we re ratchet up the pressur and we re go to continu to do that q is there a possibl georg that by the time all these increment step ar taken the serb will have achiev their goal and then what s the purpos mr stephanopoulo i think the purpos is to get the serb to stop the aggress we ar pursu that goal on mani differ front we ar pursu it through the u n we re pursu it through direct talk we ar pursu it through tighten the sanction and we will consid lift the arm embargo we ar turn the screw up on the serb and we will continu to do that q but if the effort have been unsuccess in get the serb to stop the aggress how effect will ani campaign be to have the serb give back what thei ve gain i mean onc thei re entrench mr stephanopoulo i can t specul on that we re go to continu to press for them to come to the tabl now we re go to continu to find wai to stop the aggress but i can t see into the futur q georg on the stimulu packag hous republican sai thei re go to hold a seri of town meet on saturdai to try and explain the detail of your packag thei cite poll which show that the more peopl learn about it the less thei like it what s your strategi to counter that mr stephanopoulo the strategi we have is the on we re go to continu as you saw the presid todai point up the veri real benefit of the summer job program that thi packag will provid new summer job thi summer for kid in inner citi and suburb to do product work we ar also go to point out the benefit of the highwai monei the invest in highwai we re go to point up the benefit of immun we re go to point up the benefit of head start we ar go to sai that the republican have a choic thei can take action to creat job or thei can perpetu the gridlock of the last four year q doe it concern you though that the hous now the hous republican ar after you as well as the senat mr stephanopoulo the hous republican vote against it befor thei made a mistak then thei re make a mistak now q georg doe it strike anybodi in the administr that it s a bit strong to describ as the presid did thi morn the summer job program as quot a reaffirm of a promis of america mr stephanopoulo not at all i think it s the promis of america to give kid a chanc to reach their full potenti q govern fund job mr stephanopoulo to give peopl a chanc to work absolut that is the promis of america q i want to follow up on someth i ask yesterdai where doe summer job where doe that figur come from mr stephanopoulo that is on top of i did look at it there ar current summer job in the pipelin thi will be on top of the so it will be a total of million q the would be creat by the stimulu packag mr stephanopoulo ye q where doe that number come from becaus we ve been told all along that the stimulu packag would creat new job and accord to panetta that break down to someth like full time job and summer job mr stephanopoulo ye but the summer that s when you do their full time equival i mean individu will receiv job thi summer when you calcul it for the full time job effect you have to do i don t know what the exact formula is q seven hundr thousand part time job mr stephanopoulo or q on to four becaus it s three month mr stephanopoulo thank you q can i follow up on that did the presid misspeak thi morn when he said that some of the govern monei for these summer job will pai for privat for kid to work in the privat sector mr stephanopoulo not necessarili i mean i think that there will be grant avail that s on of the wai that you pai for the job at the same time he s also issu a challeng to the privat sector to hire kid on their own as well q tax dollar for instanc would pai for kid to work at time warner mr stephanopoulo i think the time warner is actual somebodi come forward and actual do a grant that s go to be the bulk of it there could be isol instanc though where there would be grant to busi q ha the presid spoken with ani senat republican thi week mr stephanopoulo no but there s been a lot of contact with senat republican in the white hous q at a lower level but the presid hasn t mr stephanopoulo the presid ha not no q get ani closer to get the vote mr stephanopoulo we re continu to work on it q anybodi lean your wai q on haiti the new york time seem to be report someth of a breakthrough in aristid s attitud toward the coup leader can you confirm that there ha been thi chang and what impact will it have on the process and what did pezzullo have to sai yesterdai in hi report mr stephanopoulo pezzullo did brief the princip i can t confirm what s actual happen in the talk i would leav that to the negoti themselv but mr caputo ha return to haiti we have receiv a brief here at the white hous from ambassador pezzullo and as we have said time and time again we believ that assur of secur ar import to a final resolut to a broader polit settlement q georg yesterdai you offer some select breakdown of how the stimulu would impact some state and citi can we get a complet breakdown by state of how these job would be impact mr stephanopoulo i think we have it for most state ye and i think we can get it out q could you make that gener avail mr stephanopoulo i believ we can q and could you do it by the compon of the stimulu in other word mr stephanopoulo i don t know if we can do i know that we can do it by summer job and other job i don t know how deepli it can be broken down but clearli we can break it down into summer job and other job q and can i follow up is thi the inform that jeff eller and the rest of the white hous is us in the ad in the state mr stephanopoulo i don t know if thei re ad but thei re press releas q can you describ what those press releas contain mr stephanopoulo all we re do is point out the benefit of thi packag to variou state for instanc i know that todai senat dole is head up to vermont and new hampshir and i would point out that the stimulu packag the job packag creat job in vermont it creat job in new hampshir and the peopl of those state should remind him that thi is import q where ar the releas go mr stephanopoulo thei go to the state q to whom mr stephanopoulo we can get them it s no problem q can we get it q why don t you put them out here as well mr stephanopoulo i think we can q thi afternoon would that be possibl mr stephanopoulo i ll have to check i don t know but as soon as we can q ar you focus these press releas on state where there ar moder or pragmat republican senat mr stephanopoulo i think we re try to get as mani as we can it s actual quit difficult to pull thi togeth and we re do our best we re put them out as we get them q why ar you so close track senat dole s schedul mr stephanopoulo i wa just follow it q ar press releas go along to state where he s visit mr stephanopoulo i m not sure i think that probabl there ar press releas go to vermont laughter q will there be a man in a chicken suit wait laughter q georg as the presid goe about the busi of defend what s in hi stimulu packag he doesn t address what seem to be the republican main point that you re fund it with deficit spend rather than if it s so import why not come up with the fund for it seem to be the republican argument and how do you answer that mr stephanopoulo what wa answer is we ar pai for it over time and if you look at our budget we pai for thi packag over time we believ right now the economi need a jump start for job q you re not claim ar you that that doesn t add to the deficit thi year mr stephanopoulo i m sai we re pai for it over time i didn t sai that q i know that georg but i mean from the begin the question we do have annual budget and thing deficit spend will pai for that thi year will it not mr stephanopoulo thi year thei clearli will but over time our budget fulli pai for thi program q what you re sai is that there ar save that would cover thi if it were thi year in futur year mr stephanopoulo absolut that s exactli what i said q i know that but there is go to be outstand debt it will add to the nation debt from thi year mr stephanopoulo no we re reduc the deficit by billion billion over the next four year q you mean you re reduc it below what it would have been mr stephanopoulo exactli q in fact you re ad a veri larg amount to the nation debt over the period of mr stephanopoulo but we re reduc it far more from what it would have been that s true q washington type reduct laughter q you re get to be a grumpi old man q georg ha ani decis been made about the white hous or the presid s particip in the gai right march come up in a week and a half mr stephanopoulo we re work on the presid s schedul now i believ he s go to be at the senat democrat retreat in jamestown that weekend q will he address it by phone mr stephanopoulo i don t know about that it s a littl far out but i believ he s go to be in the senat retreat q so will he have the leader in a dai or two befor the speech mr stephanopoulo i don t know i would expect that at some point he would meet with the leader of some of these group i don t know the schedul on it though q will there be an aid czar appoint prior to or in conjunct with the event mr stephanopoulo i m just not sure q april nd is earth dai what is the presid go to do to mark that and is it the case that he is go to sign the biodivers treati that dai mr stephanopoulo i know there s been some work on the biodivers treati i don t know about sign it that dai but i would expect he ll have a statement on earth dai or right around then q where is the work on the biodivers treati mr stephanopoulo i d have to check with kati mcginti i just know that there s been some work done but i don t know exactli what q when is earth dai mr stephanopoulo the nd i think q why is it you know that he is go to have a statement
