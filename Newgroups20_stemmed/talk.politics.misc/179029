them to plai in a situat where those that might be rescu might well shoot at them it wa not the fed decis to make but the firefight call the fire dept meant that waco wa depriv of a resourc that might have been need elsewher should a situat where it could have been us arisen thi is true of ani answer to a call for help from a fire depart by ani citizen sinc fire depart do answer call that depriv resourc that might be need elsewher it is not a valid reason for not call them further sinc the davidian had not been found guilti of ani crime in a court of law thei ar subject to the same protect as ani other citizen and la far as i know even crimin in prison ar not left to burn to death in a fire by cut off the water suppli in the surround area the gov t guarante that ani fire at the compound would be fatal ani fire start deliber uis lamp oil is like to be fatal i guess thi is a matter of religi faith with you the govern sai it so it must be so or haven t you been read thi thread well

neighbourhood of a resourc that might be requir in a genuin case patient in psychiatr hospit ar not left to die in fire either besid as i explain some of us here believ their distress might have been genuin ar you so certain it wasn t the gov t conveni forgot all that freedom of religion stuff freedom of religion doe not includ human sacrific nor doe it includ other form of murder there is no evid that the davidian commit human sacrific either befor of after the initi raid and self defens is not murder the gov t arguabl start or at least fan the fire themselv the govt arguabl is run by communist or the trilater commiss he did not sai it wa deliber accid do not requir conspiraci theori onli wanton disregard for human life the initi raid alon agent fire blind into wall against all

have someth to do with the continu interfer from the gov t new tax new regul and increas involv in everi aspect of our person and econom live life on a compound might becom the wai of the futur it might have to be let us hope that those who support koresh ar not allow to enforc thi upon the rest of us no on here is support koresh we ar oppos the illeg us of excess violenc by our govern against our citizen that is all their reason for support the ownership of high power weaponri ar clear enough thei hope that thi will be the catylist for the destruct of the fabric of societi and allow them to enforc their nightmar vision of the futur a societi that believ it is ok to terror peopl for their religi view will destroi itself in due time it is the fed who disrupt the fabric of societi in
