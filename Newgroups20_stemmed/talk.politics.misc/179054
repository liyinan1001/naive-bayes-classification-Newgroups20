subject clinton am press brief by dee dee myer the white hous offic of the press secretari for immedi releas april press brief by dee dee myer the brief room a m edt ms myer at p m we re have a press confer bill in the east room and then saturdai the presid will leav here at roughli a m and fly down to jamestown he will spend the dai there overnight at camp david on sundai it s unclear exactli what time he ll leav camp david and fly to boston he ll leav from hagerstown the press plane will leav from washington he will meet with some q what kind of a plane is that he s take ms myer that he s take he ll probabl take a c q from hagerstown ms myer from hagerstown air forc on doesn t fly out of hagerstown appar q how will the pool travel ms myer the pool will have to meet him ahead of time so i guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport there is current no provis and i ll doubl check becaus there s current no provis i think that s standard oper practic q the pool is not go to meet him and watch him get on the plane at hagerstown ms myer i don t believ so q what time doe he have to be in boston ms myer he s go to meet there with a group of citizen mostli peopl who support us dure the campaign at around p m we re still work out the final time q at the airport ms myer no it will be at the boston harbor hotel and then he will also meet with some a youth group that author someth call project the speech to the publish is actual at p m it will be follow by q a and then after the speech and q a he ll attend a recept with the publish and then return to washington from boston and that s it for the weekend q ha the presid seen the report from or the letter commun from the foreign servic offic also obvious the commun from madelein albright and what is hi reaction to their call on him ms myer well obvious the letter wa written to secretari christoph i believ secretari christoph receiv the letter on saturdai he review it and met with the author on mondai to discuss their view he believ it s an import part of the polici make process and is take their view into account as we go forward in the develop of the bosnia polici q what is the presid s reaction ms myer the presid hasn t seen the letter it wa someth that wa direct toward secretari christoph in term of he hasn t seen specif the letter but in term of their concern gener what the presid ha said is that there ar a lot of option on the tabl now includ on that weren t there befor and i think he s as is everybodi grave concern about the situat in bosnia q is he influenc by that i mean how doe he feel about the fact that all of the specialist in that area those desk offic ms myer mani of the specialist in that area i think that that is clearli part of the process it s someth their view will clearli be consid i think secretari christoph met with the group immedi to discuss their view i think he believ that there ought to be room for opinion and that those opinion ought to be consid particularli from peopl who work close on the issu q what do you mean there ar option on the tabl that weren t there befor ms myer i think the presid said last week that there were option such as lift the arm embargo to the bosnian muslim that had been previous off the tabl that ar now be consid q dee dee in term of those option madelein albright is sai that potenti there could be unilater action by the u s if the european did not go along is that on the tabl ms myer well i can t discuss anyth that would ani convers that would have happen between ambassador albright and the presid but i think the presid ha said he would certainli is work with our european alli he s had a number of convers with european leader and is try to build some consensu there q will he reach a decis will he have anyth specif to sai todai ms myer no i mean in term of there will be no new announc of polici todai q doe your statement mean he ha rule out unilater action ms myer he s continu to consult with our alli at thi point he ha said i think he s been fairli clear about it that the he believ that the u s need to act in concert with it alli on thi q on that point doe he believ that the u s though doe have built in author from the unit nation alreadi to take unilater action ms myer well i think the u n resolut make it clear that you can act unilater in support of ani humanitarian relief effort i think the broader point is that anyth we do ani option that we decid to pursu we will make sure that it is consist with u n author and if it s not we ll work with our alli to make sure that we get it q dee dee then how doe the white hous someon as distinguish as eli wiesel who sai that not enough is be done to stop the atroc go on in bosnia ms myer i think that that s why we re consid addit option i think that mr wiesel s comment yesterdai were quit compel the situat in bosnia is tragic the presid is veri concern about it he ha i think presid clinton ha work veri hard to take further action to continu to isol serbia in the world commun clearli we re consid other option becaus the presid is concern that perhap it s not enough q in term of what you were just talk about it sound like resolut justifi unilater action by the u s to protect humanitarian ms myer i don t think it i wouldn t us the word justifi it permit unilater action by ani countri in protect the deliveri of humanitarian relief but i think that s just an explan of the resolut i think ani action that we take will be consist with u n resolut or we ll work with our alli to make sure that it is permiss or we ll get further action q the presid and other offici have rule out unilater u s action in bosnia in the past you re declin to do that thi morn ms myer no i said the presid ha said repeatedli that he want to act in concert with our alli on thi q that doesn t mean that he won t act alon which ha been said befor explicitli ms myer i don t mean to impli a chang in polici the presid ha said all along that he want to act in concert with our alli on thi q on other littl question did he know about thi letter from the foreign servic offic befor it hit the paper ms myer i don t believ so secretari christoph thei mai have had a privat convers about it the presid ha not seen it q thei met on mondai right christoph met sure he must have brought that up ms myer again thei mai have talk privat about it but q dee dee what you re sai is that the albright recommend ha been reject is that correct ms myer no i didn t sai that at all i said i won t i said i wouldn t comment on ani convers or commun q she s advoc unilater action and you re sai in effect that we will not take unilater action ms myer i am not confirm anyth that madelein albright mai or mai not have recommend q given the sometim delic complic and frustrat natur of negoti with the alli on thi issu doe the presid find thi kind of letter from foreign servic offic of the state depart help to that process hurt to that ms myer i think that their view ar obvious be consid the secretari receiv that memo on saturdai and two dai later he met with them in order to have a more thorough air of their view of the basi for their view to discuss in greater detail the option that thei had present in the letter q doesn t it put some kind of pressur on addit pressur on him now from within hi own administr to act regardless of what the alli mai or mai not do ms myer i think clearli there s a broad polici review underwai now and the presid and hi advisor ar consid a number of option includ some of those outlin in the letter from the folk over at the state depart now no decis have been made on that yet but i think that there is a through review underwai and that their opinion ar be veri serious consid q if i can just follow up i guess what i m look for is what wa hi reaction to thi letter did he sai good thi bolster my posit or did he sai damn thi is just what i don t need right now ms myer i think he said thi help contribut substant to the debat it s import that all view be consid and air thoroughli that befor he make a decis he want to have the best possibl advic and inform possibl and thi i think in mani wai further that goal q so intern advic to a cabinet offici or the presid it s all open now and you wouldn t take ani umbrag or sai that thei were out of line ms myer i think that the fact that secretari christoph met with them to discuss their view and make sure thei had an opportun to have a more complet convers about it is conclus evid that their view ar welcom q doe the polici review includ what madelein albright ha suggest and what joe biden and other have suggest which is that the previou u n resolut author unilater action militari action for the deliveri of humanitarian ms myer i think all option ar on the tabl q the unilater option is on the tabl ms myer i think all option ar on the tabl q we ve had two differ q isn t that a chang dee dee q that would be a chang of polici q particularli if it includ ground troop which ha been specif rule out ms myer i think the presid ha been well no i don t that is not q ar you talk about all option ms myer all option i think the presid ha been fairli clear about that so let me just review again what he ha said he ha said that the presid ha said all option ar on the tabl with the except of the introduct of ground troop which he ha never suggest he ha rule that out from the begin q hasn t he rule out unilater action of ani sort ms myer he ha said that he doesn t believ the u s can solv the problem in the former yugoslavia by itself i think that there ar a number of veri complic option on the tabl right now i don t think that again i don t want to comment on specif option that ar be consid other than in the broad categori that we ve alreadi said thing like lift the arm embargo against the bosnian muslim thing that i think we ve talk about in broad term thi is a veri complic situat the option be present and consid ar veri complic q air strike on the tabl ms myer again i think that s been fairli clearli point out that that s someth that s be discuss q dee dee ar ground troop on the ms myer no ground troop ar not be consid q you said there wa not go to be you said you were not announc a chang of polici then you said everyth is on the tabl we re confus ar unilater action on the tabl ms myer all i can tell you is what the presid ha said that he doesn t believ that he want to act in concert with the alli on thi q want to but he s will to i mean if thei don t go along ms myer he s continu to consult with our alli on thi he s continu to have discuss he s continu to press them for further action and i think that s clear the convers is ongo we re go to continu to work with them to find the best possibl solut and next step on thi q dee dee the alli have taken the posit that to conduct ani kind of air strike in bosnia would have the opposit effect of ensur the deliveri of humanitarian aid that thei feel that their troop on the ground monitor the deliveri of that aid would becom vulner and the bosnian ms myer i m not sure that s the consist i mean i m not sure who you re refer to q the british and the french q ye the british and french thei ve taken the posit that the deliveri of humanitarian aid would be jeopard by ani kind of air strike against the bosnian militari doe the u s believ differ from that ms myer the presid ha had convers with both mitterrand and major as you know i think that there is a thorough review of polici go on in those countri as well and i don t want to comment on the natur of the presid s discuss other than to sai that he s continu to consult with our alli as we move forward and he s continu to press them for further action and i think that process is ongo q the other dai vote against ani militari intervent yesterdai doe the presid regard that as the end of the line or doe he doe still hold out some possibl of unilater action the alli have been veri veri plain that thei do not want to do anyth ms myer the consult ar ongo that s all i can tell you at thi point q ar you sai that there won t be ani announc on bosnia todai in the press confer ms myer no that is not the intent of the press confer q what is the intent ms myer it s an opportun to take question he mai have a brief i m sure he ll have a brief open statement but it is not an opportun to outlin a new polici on bosnia that will not happen q can you tell us what the subject of the open statement is ms myer it s sort of a gener statement of where we ar q after the first hundr dai you mean ms myer it s not a long statement i mean thi is just gener don t look for ani major polici pronounc q do you know what the open statement is ms myer but it s perhap later todai i ll be abl to tell you with more certainti i think that s still under review but the overrid purpos of thi it s not a mysteri it s not meant to be it s just to take question q it would be help to know whether what the open statement is on ms myer sinc the major purpos here is just to take question it s not complet resolv yet q dee dee on polici that wa expect last week and that the white hous you and georg seem to indic we might get would be an aid czar will he announc that todai and what s the delai on that ms myer i don t think we meant to impli i think we said it would happen soon i don t think we meant to impli with ani certainti that it would be thi week it is come soon i don t anticip that happen todai q what s the delai isn t thi the perfect time to announc an aid czar ms myer i don t know that it s a delai i think the process is ongo to find the best possibl person and to go through the necessari background check and to make sure that we ve cross the t s and dot the i s befor we make an announc q dee dee what ar zoe baird s qualif for the foreign intellig advisori board and why wasn t her appoint announc here ms myer the qualif i don t know if there s a specif list i ll have to check and see i think there ar a number of peopl there on the board with differ background mani of them have long histori in intellig or other govern servic i think there s a broad varieti of view across polit spectrum and across background that ar repres there we never made a formal announc other than the chairman of the board which is admir william crow q why would he appoint her though if the american peopl and mani in the senat reject her for anoth govern job ms myer i don t believ that the american peopl ever had vote on her and i certainli she wa never reject in the senat she never went up there for a hear but the presid believ she s a veri compet person he s said that zoe baird do you understand what the question is zoe baird is on the presid s foreign intellig q you said she never went up there for a hear q her nomin wa withdrawn after public outrag over violat feder law ms myer right she never she wa never but you said she wa reject by the senat i wa just simpli try to point out that she wa never vote on by the senat q so you don t think that is ani problem ms myer i don t think there s ani problem q she ha been appoint to thi board is that a fact ms myer ye q doe she need confirm for thi doe she need confirm to be a member of the ms myer no it s a presidenti appoint q usual announc ar made here at the white hous wa there a decis not to announc her publicli ms myer we didn t make an announc peopl who ask were told who the member of the board were we didn t make an offici announc if anybodi s interest in that we can certainli put out the list of name q i d like to know q don t such board member don t you normal as a matter of routin put out releas on all these board and presidenti appoint regardless of their dimens ms myer not alwai but again i m happi to put thi out q isn t that the standard practic q that wa past practic ms myer again i m happi to put it out we ll put out a list of the member of the board todai q dee dee i don t want to try to fail to let you get out of thi swamp but laughter all i realli want to know is hasn t it been the practic in thi administr for such announc to be made routin ms myer i think gener but not alwai and we re happi to put that out todai q what is the board what is her titl what is the size of the board ms myer there is roughli a dozen member on the board it is a civilian board although their ar some obvious retir militari personnel on the board that provid input into intellig polici for the presid again the chairman of that board is admir william crow q and did he recommend baird q what s the name of the board ms myer it s the presid s foreign intellig advisori board pfiab q what s her qualif that she had emploi an illeg alien is that laughter ms myer do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke q let me phrase it anoth wai why shouldn t thi appoint be view as a pai back for the difficulti she had a coupl of month ago ms myer becaus it s not q what s her experi in foreign intellig ms myer she s an experienc attornei someon who the presid believ is veri compet and qualifi and i think part of the mission of thi board is to provid civilian input not everybodi on the board is suppos to be an intellig expert that is not the board s mission it is to provid civilian input for the presid as he make decis regard intellig matter he believ she s veri qualifi veri compet person enorm talent and ha said that throughout q is thi just a figment of my overact imagin or wa there discuss earli on about abolish the presid s foreign intellig advisori board ms myer i don t think so on decemb th when he announc all of hi foreign polici advisor he announc that he would had appoint admir crow as the head of the board so i don t believ there s ever been ani q earlier than that dure the transit ms myer no i don t believ so it wa announc again on decemb th admir crow couldn t be there but it wa announc q ar member paid ms myer i don t believ so but i ll doubl check q on anoth subject on waco how do you explain the discrep between the feder report of the autopsi of the bodi that ar come out of waco and the state i guess it s the texa ranger report ms myer most of the inform is come the feder inform is come from the site clearli there s been some discrep and the justic depart is look into it offici in the justic depart were told i believ the dai befor yesterdai that there were sever bodi found with bullet hole i think there s some discrep about that and the justic depart is look into it q is the presid go to get involv in try to sort out what seem to be becom a jurisdict morass down there with some peopl withdraw other sai thei re in charg but other justic fbi texa ranger all grab a piec of thi ms myer i don t know that he s go to try to mediat the disput i mean i ll let you know if there s anyth he intend to do about it but as you know there ar sever level of investig ongo and we re hope that thei can work togeth q is there ani on agenc or offici down there in charg of everyth ms myer i don t know i ll have to get back to you on that q what is the subject matter of sundai s speech ms myer it s go to be fairli gener i don t think it s go to be ani specif announc i think it s go to be sort of a q doe he have a topic that he s go to talk about ms myer we re still work on it but i wouldn t look for ani announc of like the drug czar or someth like that q is it sort of a dai speech sort of my excel adventur for dai laughter ms myer not exactli but i think he ll take a littl bit broader look about what s happen in the last q foreign domest ms myer a littl bit of both but i think a lot of domest q and overview ms myer ye more of an overview than a specif polici announc q ha there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the presid will address the gai right march on sundai ms myer it will be a letter read to the crowd by congresswoman nanci pelosi q is that avail ms myer not yet but it will be sure q ar you go to put it out here or ms myer we ll probabl put it out here on sundai q travel next week ms myer unclear q what wa the question q like ms myer i don t q like possibl ms myer possibl q what s possibl ms myer

not made a regular practic as some of hi predecessor have of go to camp david in fact he s been there what onc or twice ms myer twice q why thi weekend ms myer he went two weekend ago as you know on
