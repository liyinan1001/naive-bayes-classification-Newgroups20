spoken to her todai q why doe he have noth to sai about thi publicli except on the piec of paper that wa put out last night at p m ms myer he did he answer a question about it yesterdai q befor anyth had happen ms myer befor anyth happen he put out q sinc someth ha happen he s had noth to sai ms myer he s put out a statement on it last night and we ll have more to sai about it later todai q in what forum is that go to be ms myer it will be at the photo in the rose garden q he will talk about waco at that ms myer ye he ll have someth to sai q is that someth we can take live ms myer i think it will be brief we can talk a littl later about the exact structur as we work it out but i don t know if it s someth you d want to take live q will he take question on waco at that time as well ms myer he ll probabl take a few q is there ani reason why he hasn t talk to the attornei gener ms myer i ll have to doubl check i don t know that he hasn t talk to her thi morn q and she didn t come here thi morn to see him or anyon els ms myer no q and he didn t talk yesterdai q what s the reaction to her resign statement that she made last night ms myer she wa ask a question about it and she answer the question the presid ha absolut no intent of ask for the attornei gener s resign he stand behind her percent as you know he wa inform about the decis he take full respons for that and stand percent behind attornei gener reno q the question now aris yesterdai we were told that he wa brief on thi but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan wa and the justif for the plan and the justif of the time wa he fulli inform on all of that all of thi about the increas level of violenc insid the compound that made them want to go now the feel that noth els wa go to succe et cetera ms myer he talk with the attornei gener about the decis about she talk to him about the factor that led to her decis he rais no object he support her decis to go forward with it he wa fulli brief q of cours hindsight is but look back now doe the presid doe the white hous feel that the decis he sign off on prove to be the right wai to go when you look at what actual happen ms myer i think everybodi feel bad when life is lost but i don t think that that is reason to second guess the decis he stand behind the decis that wa made he wa inform about it he wa fulli brief about it and he stand percent behind the attornei gener the justic depart and the fbi it s a difficult oper and there s it had alreadi gone on for more than seven week four feder agent had lost their live in the line of duti let s not forget that thi wa a veri difficult situat and all the decis involv were veri difficult but all the agent on the ground the fbi the justic depart all recommend move forward with thi thei thought given the circumst it wa the best possibl cours of action there s just no point in second guess those decis now i think that there s a reason q why not thei have to ms myer no not to second guess the decis i think it s import to take a look at it to have an investig i think the presid will talk some about that later todai but at thi from thi vantag point to second guess those decis it s not us q you sound like he s go to order an investig of what happen and whether ms myer i think he ll have more to sai about that later ye q he will order an investig ms myer he ll have more ye he ll have more to sai about an investig q what kind of investig ms myer he ll have more to sai about it later q but in the mondai morn quarterback sure there is some soul search now as to whether it wa the right decis you can t sai that we did the best we could when it turn out to be a rather a debacl ms myer i think we ll obvious we ll review the situat and all the factor that lead to a veri tragic outcom i don t think anybodi disput that the outcom wa tragic but again the presid stand behind the decis that were made and we ll take a look at the factor that contribut to that q what wa the fbi director s role in thi ms myer well he wa obvious involv in set up the oper he sign off on it as did the agent that were on the ground that were work with him i don t believ he spoke to the presid but i ll doubl check that q but he wa veri close involv in everi aspect of plan and so forth ms myer i would refer you to the fbi on exactli what aspect he wa involv with q will janet reno be come over to the white hous todai ms myer there s no plan meet i don t believ that she ll be here q she won t be at thi event at p m ms myer no no plan to be q do you think that there s go to be a jump on on the part of polit opposit to make someth out of thi in term of to the presid s detriment polit ms myer well i would certainli hope that peopl wouldn t try to us thi tragedi for polit reason obvious i think again that it s us to look at the fact to reevalu the fact and i think the presid will move forward with that but i think peopl understand that thi wa a difficult seri of decis that it wa a veri difficult situat that it wa caus by a man who wa a cult leader who wa involv in the death of four feder agent and i think it s most tragic that a lot of innoc children lost their live in thi i don t think anybodi disput the tragedi of the outcom q dee dee what wa the white hous role in handl the i guess public relat aspect in the aftermath who wa talk who here at the white hous wa talk with peopl at justic to set up reno s new confer to do all that sort of thing ms myer i think the attornei gener handl her end of the situat herself and made the decis to go ahead with the new confer onc there wa a point at which there wa enough inform i think to talk with some accuraci about what had transpir dure the dai obvious peopl here at a number of level were keep in touch with peopl at the justic depart and at the fbi to try to keep inform about what wa happen there q but reno said that she didn t talk to the presid and there seem to be an indic she hadn t talk to anybodi at the white hous so who ms myer there were peopl talk on a staff to staff level q i understand but who at the justic depart wa handl that for reno who wa talk to the white hous ms myer there were a number of peopl as you know webb hubbel is the liaison to the white hous and i know he talk to a number of peopl here there were a number of peopl at a number of differ level involv i don t want to get into exactli who had what convers with whom but there were a number of convers obvious the justic depart wa work to keep the white hous inform the press inform to the best of it abil as event unfold throughout the dai q did webb hubbel talk to the presid ms myer i don t believ so i don t know if he talk he mai have at on point q and wa the white hous role just to seek inform about what happen or wa it to direct the public inform campaign that follow ms myer it wa both to keep abreast of the situat so the presid could be on top of it but i think the justic depart manag it press relat on it we were obvious veri interest in what wa happen there throughout the dai and the presid wa follow it veri close throughout the dai q dee dee on that though if the presid wa follow it so close and he had talk the night befor with janet reno why wouldn t he talk to her at all sinc then ms myer again i don t know if he s talk to her thi morn again he s kept fulli awar of what ha been go on throughout the dai he stand percent behind her decis he s been fulli support of her as he said yesterdai morn befor event transpir and yesterdai afternoon in a written statement q but wouldn t he want to convei those thought to her person yesterdai ms myer on more time i don t know if thei ve spoken thi morn q no yesterdai q clearli there s a percept that she wa left hung out to dry all dai yesterdai ms myer that s just not true i think we said throughout the dai that the presid take full respons that he stand i don t know how much clearer we can be the presid stand foursquar behind the attornei gener on thi he accept full respons for the event that transpir he believ that janet reno the justic depart and the fbi act as best thei could given the circumst and the fact that were evid at the time i don t know what els he can sai to show that he support her percent q on of the best indic of that is to pick up the phone and tell her ms myer again i don t know whether thei ve spoken thi morn q why can t we find out ms myer well we can i can t do it stand here right now q you ve got six peopl here all thei ve got to do is pick up the phone ms myer helen we ll get back to you q dee dee when the presid spoke with the attornei gener on sundai is it safe to assum that either she volunt or he inquir about whether there wa a possibl downsid to increas pressur on the davidian ms myer i think that thei discuss the situat again i m not go to get into the specif detail of what exactli she told him but i think that he wa awar of the risk involv q dee dee the presid yesterdai morn said it wa entir her decis she then said that she told him what wa happen and he said okai doe the presid regard it that he gave the go ahead or that she gave the go ahead ms myer i think what thei both said yesterdai wa that she made a decis base on all the avail fact she inform him about that and he rais no object again i don t know how much clearer we can be about that q and he said okai the issu is over the respons ms myer he said okai q doe okai mean ms myer the presid accept ultim respons q dee dee the presid s investig that he s go to announc would that be conduct by someon outsid the administr ms myer no q it would be intern is it meant to preclud ani congression investig ms myer no it s meant simpli to follow up on the incid that occur yesterdai q and you would i assum therefor cooper fulli with ani congression hear that would be held ms myer to the best of our abil q dee dee there ar two report out thi morn on that the justic depart or fbi or whomev appar had a bug plant insid the complex and the other is that the children mai have been inject with some kind of poison that mai have either left them unconsci or mayb even kill them befor the fire what do you know about those two ms myer noth more than i ve seen in new account thi morn we mai get more on it later but at thi point i know i m not sure anybodi know ani more than what wa report by peopl who came out of the compound q ha the presid receiv ani report todai in term of fatal and actual what wa go on what thei ve been abl to find out on in the compound now ms myer he s been brief i don t think that thei ve gotten into the compound yet thei were still wait for it to cool off i don t think there s much beyond what s been report in the new account but he ha been kept up to date on it q dee dee the presid stand behind attornei gener reno but doe he feel that she perhap got bad advic from the so call expert ms myer he believ that she made he stand behind the decis that she made it wa the unanim decis of her advisor of the fbi of the agent on the ground and he support that q what about the valid of the decis made on the ground doe he back those ms myer he s not go to second guess decis made q dee dee you just said he stand behind the decis which she made normal in a situat like thi the presid sai i made the decis but you re sai she made the decis ms myer i m sai that the presid wa brief about the decis he okai it and he accept full respons for it q but then why do you keep us the terminolog the decis that she made rather than the decis that he made ms myer becaus as he said yesterdai she evalu the fact base on evid present to her by justic depart and fbi which is part of the justic depart and made a decis and then brief the presid on that decis that is how the chain of command work she brief him he sign off on it the oper went forward and the presid accept full respons q in that chain of command analog there i want to go back to session a moment do you know if thi wa a plan that came through him to reno or wa it present to her around him or with hi involv what wa hi involv ms myer again you d have to go to the justic depart for the specif interact between the attornei gener and the director q doe the presid stand behind director session ms myer he support again i don t know how mani differ wai i can sai thi he support the decis made by the justic depart and the fbi he fulli support the attornei gener in thi i m not step awai from the director of the fbi i want to but janet reno is the on who brief him the on who made the decis as the head of the justic depart as you know the director of the fbi report to the attornei gener the attornei gener made the decis she inform the presid about those decis he okai it he didn t rais ani object to it and he accept full respons q do you have base on what you know here at the white hous ani concern about william session perform dure thi ms myer noth to suggest that no q along those same line just in your initi review of the situat how much do you think the problem might have come from not have a justic depart that s fulli staf and have an fbi director who is still quit uncertain about hi statu ms myer i just don t think that had anyth to do with it i think the agent on the ground the oper went forward i m not go to specul on that q did the white hous express ani alarm that janet reno chose to speak to the live network media befor she chose to speak to clinton ms myer no she wa carri forward her respons to inform the public about the event of yesterdai i think she did a veri admir job the presid agre with that q befor sundai how often wa the presid brief on the situat in waco ms myer he wa kept updat on a regular basi on a daili basi q who brief the presid ms myer well i m not go to get into exactli who what convers he had with whom but he wa kept up to date on the event in waco he ha daili brief on a number of issu q no no wa thi a regular brief conduct by a white hous staff person or wa it by a justic depart person ms myer he s brief regularli by a white hous staff on a number of issu again i m not go to get into exactli who brief him on what subject q anoth subject q on anoth subject q now we re go to do gai in the militari laughter ms myer i welcom it q how close ar you to sign the biodivers treati ms myer as you know the presid s give a speech on earth dai tomorrow we ll have more to sai about it then q ani detail on where or when that speech is yet ms myer it s at a m and i don t know where yet q dee dee is thi a major polici address how would you character the speech tomorrow ms myer i would character it as a earth dai speech i wouldn t look for ani major departur from hi past posit on these thing but again i don t want to get too much into what he s go to talk about tomorrow q on or off campu q is thi at a locat outsid the white hous ms myer it will be somewher in washington we don t know exactli where yet q dee dee what foreign leader ha the presid talk to sinc fridai on the situat in bosnia ms myer onli prime minist major and again he ll try to reach presid mitterrand again thi morn q david owen said yesterdai and joe biden said todai both of them agre that the peac process is not go to work that the serb ar not go to sign on doe the administr still believ that it can work and that thei will sign on ms myer obvious the ultim goal is some sort of peac resolut to the conflict in bosnia as you know the administr is consid a wide varieti of option at thi point the situat there in and around srebrenica and the rest of eastern bosnia is quit seriou and the presid will meet with hi bosnian advisor todai and continu to press forward on thi q is that a question thei re go to try to be decid whether or not the peac plan remain viabl ms myer again thei ll be review

all of the foreign head of state that ar here q dee dee ha the presid decid whether he support the gai and lesbian civil right act and ha anyth been work out for him to address the march on sundai ms myer i think he ll probabl have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march we haven t work out the exact detail of that q not a live phone hook up ms myer probabl not given the logist of get to boston the speech as you know is at p m the answer to the other part of your question is no he hasn t taken a posit on it q you said that speech in boston wa at p m ms myer i believ so ye q do you
