subject clinton presid s radio interview in pittsburgh the white hous offic of the press secretari pittsburgh pennsylvania for immedi releas april interview of the presid by michael white of kdka am radio pittsburgh pittsburgh intern airport pittsburgh pennsylvania a m edt q for everyon listen on kdka radio i m mike white kdka radio new we re here at the pittsburgh intern airport and with me is the presid of the unit state bill clinton and i d like to welcom you to the area and to kdka the presid thank you mike glad to be here q there ar a lot of thing we d like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have but some new is just break from lo angel i guess the entir countri ha been kind of hold their breath wonder what s go to happen in the trial of the four lo angel polic offic we just heard that two of those offic the sergeant sergeant koon and offic powel have been found guilti and two offic have been found not guilti it s a situat that s been build for over a year sinc the first trial and now thi trial and thi verdict and i wonder what your thought ar thi morn on how you see the situat in lo angel in connect with your administr and what you re try to do the presid well first of all i think the american peopl should know that thi trial in my judgment is a tribut to the work and judgment of the juri as well as to the effort of the feder govern in develop the case the law under which the offic were tri is a complex on the standard of proof ar complic the juri decid that thei would convict the sergeant who wa respons for supervis the offic and the offic who on the film did most of the beat the juri acquit an offic who kick rodnei king but also plainli tri to shield him from some blow and anoth offic who wa a rooki no on know exactli why thei did what thei did but it appear that thei realli tri to do justic here thei acknowledg that hi civil right were violat and i think that the american peopl should take a lot of pride in that but i hope now we can begin to look ahead and focu on three thing first of all the import of try to bring thi countri togeth and not violat the civil right of ani american secondli the import of renew our fight against crime i think it s import to recogn that in the poorest area of lo angel and mani other citi in thi countri peopl mai be worri about polic abus but thei re even more worri about crime it s time that we renew our effort to go to commun polic put more polic offic on the street pass the bradi bill that would requir a wait period befor peopl could bui a handgun and do some other thing to reduc the vulner of our peopl to violenc and drug and the last point i d like to make is it seem to me that we have got to reded ourselv to the econom revit of our citi and other econom distress area if you just think about it if everybodi in lo angel who want a job had on i don t think we d have quit as mani problem as we do and i laid out a veri ambiti program in the campaign to try to bring privat invest and public invest to bear in our citi i have dispatch the commerc secretari ron brown to california to try to come up with some strategi for that state becaus it s our biggest state with our highest unemploy rate which could then be appli around the countri i want to talk to him and to the attornei gener to the new head of the naacp to reverend jackson and to sever other peopl and then i ll decid where to go from here with regard to lo angel and the other citi of the countri q let s talk about what bring you to the pittsburgh area todai there have been i guess there s been a lot of discuss on capitol hill about your stimulu packag you ve been lock in a battl with the gop yesterdai as you said earlier in your radio address you made some move to break that gridlock what bring you to pittsburgh in particular to allegheni counti in particular to pennsylvania with that battl the presid well there ar two reason first of all pittsburgh allegheni counti and pennsylvania support me in the last elect becaus thei want a new direct in econom polici we have pass our overal econom plan it give the countri a veri differ budget for the next five year than we ve had in the previou we reduc the deficit and at the same time increas invest in job and educ and health care in the thing that will make us a stronger countri but in addit to that i ask the congress in the short run to spend a littl more monei a modest amount of monei to creat anoth half million job in the next year and a half to try to cut the unemploy rate by a half a percent but also to try to spark job creation in the privat sector more the plan pass the hous it ha the support of a major of the senat at the present time all the republican senat as a bloc ar filibust the bill that is thei won t let it come to a vote i believ that senat specter would like to vote for the bill and i believ that senat dole the republican leader ha put a lot of pressur on a lot of the republican to stai hitch and thei re all sai that thi bill increas the deficit it doesn t thi bill is well below the spend target that congress approv includ the republican for thi year thi bill is paid for by budget cut in the next five year thi bill is design to give a jump start to the economi and i must sai a lot of the republican senat that ar hold it up when mr bush wa presid vote for billion of dollar of emerg spend of just thi kind much of it wa total unrel to creat job so what i m try to do is to break thi logjam i ve held out an oliv branch i ve offer a compromis but i think that we ought to try to put some more american to work right now to show that we re chang the direct of the countri and that s the purpos of the bill q have you been in touch with senat specter or hi offic late the presid well we ve been try to talk regularli to through my white hous congression liaison oper to the senat that we think ar open to thi senat specter senat d amato from new york senat jefford from vermont senat hatfield from oregon and five or six other whom we believ know we need more job in thi economi and know that we ar pai for thi with budget cut over the life of the budget i present you know it ha a lot of appeal to sai well we ve got a big deficit we shouldn t increas it more but the truth is that we ar pai for thi with budget cut in the whole life of the budget over the next few year and more importantli we have thi program well below the spend target that congress ha alreadi approv for thi year and thei ve done thi for year with the republican vote for it mani republican vote for it for thing that weren t nearli as import as put the american peopl back to work so i just hope that thi doesn t becom a polit issu it ought to just be about the peopl of thi countri and the need for job q i have some question from peopl who support you and some peopl who ar skeptic about your administr it ha to do with their hope and also with their fear a lot of peopl who support you and vote for you in pennsylvania i think some of them ar now sai we re glad we got him in the white hous but now look at thi incred process he ha to go through look at these problem look at thi gridlock and thei re begin to wonder is thi go to work can you pull it off and of cours your skeptic ar sai well i knew it wa go to be like thi the presid well what i would i d ask peopl first of all to rememb that we ar frankli move veri fast the budget resolut that the congress pass is the fastest thei have ever pass a budget resolut ever in histori set out the next five year budget target so we ar move realli rapidli and we ve got them work on polit reform welfar reform health care reform a whole wide rang of thing but it s a big oper you can t expect to turn it around overnight it took year to produc the condit which led to the victori i receiv from the peopl in novemb and we can t turn it around in dai but i think we re make real real progress i would urg the peopl not to get discourag we re not go to win everi battl and not everyth is go to happen overnight but we ar definit move and chang thing q thank you veri much the presid of the unit state bill clinton here live at pittsburgh intern airport i m mike white kdka new end a m edt
