articl c rt t ewp voder nsc com matt galaxi nsc com matt freivald x write is an unborn child a human be at ani point dure pregnenc in my opinion at all point dure the pregnanc it is human you ll have to defin what you mean by human be for me to answer the question as put a parallel q is a person of color a human be a you ll have to defin what you mean by human be to answer your irrelev question ye a person of color is human but i still don t know what you mean by human be and you have mere beg the question without respond by try to inject the notion of race into the discuss you muddi the water without ad ani insight whatev the same parallel question could be is a polydactyl person a human be you still have not answer what you mean by human be pleas do so i would suggest that legal preced defin a human be i e a person whose right ar protect by the constitut and the law as someon with a function brain could you cite some of those preced for me or the basi of thi definit while the law doe allow the remov of extraordinari mean of sustain life in case of brain death thi in itself doe not lead to your conclus of how the law defin a human be howev at least you defin human be in a tenuou fashion that is a person whose right ar protect by the constitut and the law for my answer to your question i refer you to roe v wade and subsequ suprem court decis which defin to what extent a fetu is protect by the constitut and the law certain judg have concur that slaveri is not a violat of human right therefor it is not you won t answer the question and instead drag in irrelev if you want a definit of human be that doe not depend on the vagari of law but hold solid whatev the law mai rule provid it for me i would suggest that your blind faith would not like hold up if the shoe were on the other foot the brain life death paradigm is on that i suggest as on consist with other legal definit it clearli doesn t matter to you whether an unborn child ha ani right or not howev so the point is lost on you more irrelev as larri margoli point out the law ha made special except in order to includ fetus but doe not follow your version of human be and as he point out brain death is not a mean of determin who ha the right of the live but rather who ha di there is a signific differ what i am wonder now is ha your argument so fail you that you feel it necessari to drag out irrelev and leav the thread you start you got answer to your question when you began bait me if you recal after you had made some ridicul remark about adrienn regard and have been correct chang the subject with your remark about have a discuss of substanc if you realli want a discuss of substanc why then do you disregard logic and substanc in order to toss silli accuss e g it realli doesn t matter to you if it matter to you then why not defin human be and seek some substanc you re not go to convinc a logic person of the right of your posit unless you appli some logic and show some mean to your word if she is then why doe the mother have the right to kill her when she is in the womb but not after she ha pass through the birth canal becaus a woman ha a right to have ani object which threaten her health and is within the confin of her bodi remov the other side of the argument would give right to the fetu that would not be grant to an adult human if for exampl you were occupi the bodi of anoth for whatev reason or through whatev mean the reason and mean be irrelev that other would be abl to remov or have you remov if that remov requir your demis i see no reason in law that such a remov could not be effect rather than examin a hypothet thought experi let us examin a real though rare situat siames twin if on siames twin ha the other surgic remov know that it will caus death and bar some emerg where thei will both die anywai it is murder is it have you ani support for thi assert furthermor your analog is complet inapplic siames twin have an equal claim to ani bodi part thei have in common try again what establish thi equal claim beyond your assert if it is mere a matter of which came first cannot on kill the other sinc thei both have equal claim what if on ha more motor control than the other doe that establish a superior claim as other point out on is sacrif for the other depend on which ha the better chanc at surviv again your analog fail not preced but possess make a differ here a woman s womb is indisput her own also i see you ignor my statement that you would grant right to a fetu that would not be grant a born human be wa that due to it inconveni you see the right to life is grant to adult human in the same sens as it should be to the foetu at some point prior to birth ar siames twin ever separ in the womb or is thi right you assert for siames twin which i don t even think is true as state or valid as an analog on that exist after birth freivald your entir argument here is a failur interest wai of try to combin two essenti orthogon concept the point is that it is murder for on siames twin to kill the other regardless of their statu of physiolog depend or interdepend is it pleas cite a preced and the basi of the rule it would be difficult for on siames twin to kill the other insid the womb and even if it were possibl i doubt that a case could be made for premedit or negleg note the us of the phrase it should be in my post you simpli assert thing without ani support your analog is not accur and your assert ar unsupport try thi on for size it is not murder for on siames twin to kill the other in the womb there we now have equal argument but the idea is illog for on siames twin to kill the other in the womb would like be to kill itself as well the system ar depend on each other for life i m still struggl to see anyth analag here and fail to do so of cours the situat is not a perfect comparison it mai well be that on siames twin deliber initi oppress or coersion against the other thi is clearli not the case with an unborn child and thi last statement from you is a total non sequitur the comparison is far wors than you give it credit for ar you go to let thi assert stand on it own also or do you plan on follow up with a reason argument your argument is from fantasi island your comparison is a total failur as i have demonstr alreadi and ha no basi in realiti neither legal nor medic and for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison becaus of the imposs that of coercion or oppress is ridicul as i said you give the analog too littl credit for failur on the on hand you start thi by sai you want to take a real rather than a hypothet situat then you fly off into siames twin murder on anoth in the womb or coerc or oppress each other in the womb when the realiti of the situat you describ in now wai match your version as i said befor decis ar made regard which twin live and di in situat where thei cannot both surviv and furthermor as i have alreadi said there is a differ between an equal claim to organ and a claim that is unequ you seem to be assert that a fetu ha a claim on a woman s womb when the fetu is born what happen to it claim and by what reason do you assert it claim if a parent ha the right to choos to not take respons for their own child why ar there law and penalti against child abandon thi last question is irrelev and someth of a non sequitur can you establish some relev or even some sens for it if at some point an unborn child is a human be the parent clearli have the same respons toward her as ani other parent have toward their children again what is the relev you have establish no sens of when that point is you ignor the signific differ between a fetu and a born child the depend of a born child can be transfer to anoth parti while that of a fetu cannot a born child doe not live within the bodi of anoth human be while a fetu doe therebi repres potenti and often actual harm to that bodi as in the case of on of our talk abort particip who suffer from epilepsi and to whom pregnanc repres a signific health risk or as in the case of a woman i know who chose to continu her pregnanc but spent her entir pregnanc confin to a wheelchair and suffer great pain from constrict of some nerv and your argument is not an argument against abort gener but at best an argument against abort at some time dure the cours of pregnanc again a quest for common ground most of the pro choic peopl i have spoken to in person none of them pro abort activist conced that the child ha a right to life at some point that supersed all of the mother s right except that of her own life as is often the case in emotion charg issu the activist have a veri differ outlook from the mainstream you haven t answer the question the situat ar not analag the depend of a born child is not transfer instantan it take time and effort incident it is the pro choic side not me argu that the govern should make it easi for parent to abandon their children to the state again you avoid the question depend can be transfer and it is not as slow as you seem to think as to the anecdot evid of real human tragedi there is ampl on both side i would hate to be in the posit of the mother in nyc who ha to tell her daughter that she lost her arm in a botch abort attempt ye and i d hate to have been the on to tell dr gunn s children that he wa murder by a religi pro life fanat pleas do try to stai relev the kindest thing i can sai about these respons of your is that i can see you ar try to sai someth but the result is a mish mash of neglig valu sez you clever comeback i congratul you on the readi of your wit in articl in talk polit misc decai cbnewsj cb att com dean kaflowitz write ground cover in anoth post delet if at some point an unborn child is a human be the parent clearli have the same respons toward her as ani other parent have toward their children and no parent can be forc to suppli bodili resourc toward their children even if necessari to save the child s life as wa thi to make it painfulli clear you ar not oblig to donat a kidnei to save your child s life under law again the confus between action deliber take awai the life of a child and inact refus to run out in front of a bu to save a child what happen to that claim to bodili organ where life is at stake why doe thi parent now have an indisput right to hi or her kidnei when previous the parent did not by your standard what is differ about the two situat i see i have to spell thi out for you sinc the mean wa too subtl for you in the on case you do not recogn a differ between a fetu and a born child you ask why a born child cannot be abandon but a fetu can and in thi case you recogn a signific differ between the fetu and born child where the live of the two ar at stake you can t have it both wai action and inact ar irrelev to the principl but you ar wrong about the inact anywai ask ani of the numer women who post here and have born children how inact their pregnanc wa to have a healthi live child a woman doe more than hang out eat as she choos plai volleybal like she alwai did drink at parti with her friend etc she behav veri differ and the provis of her resourc to a fetu mai be no more voluntari than the beat of her heart but it is far from inact dean kaflowitz
