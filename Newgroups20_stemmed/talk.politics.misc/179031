subject re drug and crime a new approach mwilson ncratl atlantaga ncr com mark wilson write miss the entir point of my post kebarn msuvx memst edu wrote given that the trade in illeg drug is respons for much of the crime which afflict our nation there is much evid that it is the fact that the drug ar illeg not the drug themselv that have caus the violenc wit prohibit and the violenc that surround the trade in alcohol no joke peopl who want drug particularli peopl who ar predispos to addict will find a wai to get them whether or not thei ar legal avail thi is supposs to be an argument for keep drug illeg no you jump to that conclus it s actual an argument as to how to accomplish the societ good of discourag drug us without violat individu right despit current law enforc effort drug ar readili avail to those who want them thi is supposs to be an argument for keep drug illeg no you miss the point the point is the war on drug is a failur and is counterproduct addict to drug boh legal and illeg is respons for a signific drain on the product resourc of our countri and thi occur in a varieti of wai from the cocain addict babi who ar unabl to learn to the spread of diseas among addict to the tragic consequ of alcohol abus and tobacco smoke the crack babi scenario ha been thouroughli discredit it just so happen that the symptom seen in the crack babi ar ident to fetal alcohol syndrom and the mother who admit to take crack also admit to drink heavili dure pregnanc in thi countri peopl ar free to be stupid if thei want to but thei ar not free to be stupid and injur other peopl admittedli the fetal right to life is outsid the scope of thi discuss howev it s ridicul to assert as you appar do that cocain ha no effect on the develop fetal nervou system caffien and nicotin have fetal effect too why should cocain be ani except a gener econom principl of govern is that whatev is subsid you get more of and whatev is tax you get less of to be most effect in confront the nation s drug problem some wai must be found to util these addit power of govern to make drug deal and drug us less attract so make the drug legal tax them and us the tax monei to fund a program to tell peopl how studid drug ar it ha work for the legal drug if you had read my articl befor write your knee jerk respons you would have seen that thi is exactli what i advoc while thi countri s current effort to combat legal drug have succeed in some respect there is a greater awar of the health consequ of smoke and design driver program have help reduc drunk drive for exampl the same cannot be said for the war on illeg drug there remain a core group of illeg drug user which support intern network of smuggler pusher grower processor kingpin and gangster these network and their market activ which includ drive by shoot corrupt law enforc author and smuggl weapon ar directli or indirectli respons for a larg proport of the crime commit in our countri everi dai each and everi on of these problem is a direct result of the drug trade be illeg no shit sherlock clearli illeg drug and rise crime ar link it take onli a moment s reflect to recogn how thei ar link the link is monei as with thi countri s fail effort to prohibit alcohol consumpt a black market ha been creat in which greedi local monopoli like the gangster of a bygon era have profit enorm from their illeg trade the victim of thi trade includ not onli the innoc peopl unfortun enough to be caught in the crossfir but i would argu the drug user themselv a great argument for make drug legal thank you how could you have miss the point so utterli what have you been smoke here then is my propos possess and us of all present illeg drug is decrimin but bui and sell them remain illeg pothead can grow their own marijuana as mani alreadi do todai other drug user can legal import their poison of choic as long as thei pai the tariff and a barter economi of drug experiment develop your solut ha done noth to elimin the violenc in the drug trade btw how is someon go to import a drug if bui it is illeg i think you need to think your solut through a littl more thouroughli obvious import will not be bui drug in the u s under u s jurisdict us your remain brain cell becaus of the barter economi which suppli the drug user the black market profit that have so enrich the drug lord dwindl if these drug can be obtain for free or next to noth why bui them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommerci drug even at rel low price therefor you have fail to indic how these drug can be obtain for free or next to noth you have state that the sale of them is illeg o k i ll spell it out for you barter economi mean that drug user will be permit to grow or synthes chemic anyth thei choos or to bui it outsid the u s and bring it in if it won t grow here thei will also be permit to trade with other drug user for drug other than the on thei themselv grow or manufactur thei will not howev be abl to legal sell their drug for monei both manufactur and import of noncommerci drug will be tax to discourag their us thi is your brain on drug ani question law enforc activ is concentr on those individu who continu to bui and sell and also on the crime commit by drug user too poor to afford even low price but here is where the strategi begin to differenti between the drug dealer the victim and the drug user their victim in most citi thi is alreadi the strategi it ha alreadi fail and is drag the rest of us down with it pardon me but possess us of these drug is still a crime you cannot analog the rate at which drug user would seek treatment and the compar eas with which it could be made avail todai when these drug ar illeg to possess us with what it would be were thei not illeg to possess us decrimin possess and us make treatment much easier drug dealer ar exploit the weak of those person who ar prone to addict and as such the drug user should be left alon not thrown in prison along with their victim drug dealer ar the crimin and should be treat as such drug addict doe not absolv you of responsibl for your crimin action howev upon arrest for ani crime suspect ar permit to choos whether or not thei will undergo a drug test those who choos to cooper ar inform that upon convict for the crime thei ar accus of if thei ar found to be a drug user thei will be institution until thei ar clean and onli then will thei begin to serv their sentenc if thei choos to cooper and ar alreadi drug free thei can begin to serv their sentenc right awai those who choos not to undergo the drug test and ar convict face stiffer fine and serv longer sentenc thi sound a hell of a lot like self incrimin which is unconstitut if drug us is legal in your scheme why should the presenc of drug in anyon system influenc the penalti thei receiv much too big brotherish for my tast the drug test of an arrest suspect is voluntari not coerc and doe not therefor constitut violat of amend v those convict who ar drug user as evidenc by the test ar in need of treatment for their problem institution of these adddict crimin is i would argu the best wai to help them straighten out if thei refus the test and ar convict their sentenc can be appropri harsher sinc thei unlik the addict have no excus for their crime institution of drug us crimin serv sever purpos drug us crimin and thi includ drunk and or stone driver ar separ from their sourc of suppli thu reduc the total number of drug user in societi at larg and consequ decreas the demand for drug on the street put more of the remain drug dealer out of busi why should drug us crimin be treat ani differ from other crimin you have alreadi state that drug us is legal mark wilson atlantaga ncr com why not my object is to discourag drug us and crimin behavior if fewer crimin do drug out of fear of get a harsher sentenc if thei ar convict why is that not a good thing if fewer drug dealer who ar still crimin btw can find victim why is that not a good thing if fewer drug user such as drunk pothead etc commit crime out of fear of be cut off from their sourc of suppli why is that not a good thing i m certainli will to
