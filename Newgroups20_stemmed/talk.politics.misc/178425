subject re eight myth about nation health insur pt ii in articl apr new columbia edu gld cunixb cc columbia edu gari l dare write the differ in the litig environ is reflect in the fee lack of defens medicin and near absenc of malpractic is realli why we spend less us the most expens approach of pure insur then why do we realli need nation health insur then wouldn t it just make more sens to find some wai to cut down on the cost of malpractic insur and mayb that s not such a good thing i also read somewher that it is next to imposs in canada to litig against the health system class action suit ar nearli imposs and you can t sue the provinci health offici at all part of the deal for us the all insur approach like the french and german do hei why don t thei critic franc and germani is it becaus too mani peopl take french and german in colleg to make the accus stick wa to preserv the doctor independ sinc the provinci wing of the cma ar the on that go to bat when the fee schedul hike ar present the polit bent doctor were just cackl when thei realiz the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especi when unoppos unlik in social medicin approach like britain s nation health servic oh no don t let the ama know about thi thei have enough power as it is ask most american whether thei d like the doctor lobbi to get more power for non life threaten thing market argument adequ cover why certain procedur ar in scarcer demand i have md friend who can t make a live as specialist back in manitoba not due to the insur rate but becaus thei won t get enough custom the cma medic monopoli s grip on doctor licenc as in the us asid so thei must move to larger place howev thi doe not refut debunk of wait line for urgent and routin care as ha been done in the u s by consum report health polici studi cite by prof denni e shea on usenet cnn nyt etc well yeah tell us about the nation defens medic centr outsid ottawa theoret it s limit to servic personnel but some studi i ve heard about have suggest that about half the patient there ar civilian who not onli have connect but aren t urgent at all the problem is in a system where hospit annual budget ar approv by the govern how do you keep polit consider out of medic decis i bet that if you re an mp or mpp or good friend with on you re put on ani hospit s urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless you re someon who get bump off the list for some bigshot wouldn t nation health insur mean that american who ar now fulli insur might have to settl for less in canada provinci insur cover all health cost except dental care eyeglass prescript drug ambul servic and privat hospit room so mani canadian do end up bui some privat insur a polici to cover all of these thing run about to a month hmm how much differ would it make in the figur of percentag of gnp spent on health care if dentistri and optometri were includ in the account mayb canada spend proportion just as much on health care as we do of cours the on thing to note is that in the canada franc germani case privat insur offload the basic coverag to the public sector thei realiz thei were keep low risk high profit extra insur for thing like privat semi privat room vs ward accomod dental glass etc for corpor or person benefit thei ll have noth to do with you if you want to be cover for basic care at that point thei wouldn t even consid a voucher approach to broker the univers coverag and sell polici to make up the differ in the feder guidelin and market stuff so what happen if the health care system financi collaps bob rae the second least popular man in ontario warn ontarian a few year ago that if thei didn t stop cross border shop in such huge number the servic thei expect from the provinc just won t be there in a few year fortun for them and less fortun for the retail here in western new york the canadian dollar went back to a more realist valu he didn t sai so but i knew he meant the ohip what would happen if hi warn turn out to be the truth would the privat insur take up the slack thei d be under no oblig to of cours thei could eventu make monei again but if what you sai is true thei d be loath to do so and out of practic in handl such basic servic too wouldn t free care encourag peopl to run to the doctor for everi ach and pain peopl who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospit about a third more often than those who have to pai a share of their medic bill still canadian who pai noth at the doctor s have a lower per person health bill than we do it is free in that there ar no deduct nor copay two thing which i advoc to make the canadian insur look more like real health insur which actual it is i know that when work in alberta ontario and quebec i wa awar that i wa pai for health insur e g in toronto ohip fee were list on my pai stub manitoba did not collect at paychequ time but onli annual at incom tax time built into the tax rate onli fiscal naif will proclaim that it s free along with the canadian left for that is part of their brainwash agenda would that it were free american would start anoth revolut if thei had to pai tax at canadian rate isn t the privat health insur industri just too big and power to kill dismantl the health segment of our insur industri would be polit thorni in the quiet word of on advoc for a nation plan some firm now sell more than billion in health insur thei d put up a hard fight not onli ha the industri grown eightfold sinc canada shut down it own health insur but our govern leav politician more open to lobbyist than doe canada s parliamentari system health insur doe exist in canada and in western europ it just that it doesn t cover basic care you can opt out in canada and germani but you ll have to go uninsur as a result becaus there ar too few other peopl that do so i e no market when privat insur realiz how much monei thei d make without the risk involv in basic insur e g neurosurgeri versu delux amen e g have to call granada tv to replac a rental set on the fritz in someon s privat hospit room thei start to pat themselv on the back for their social respons in quebec last spring a consortium of privat insur publicli warn against ani thought of privat routin low cost part of that provinc s public health insur plan again i doubt american would like give the insur compani that much power i half wonder if the canadian health insur didn t go along with the provinc and the feder govern year ago becaus thei knew that there wa a good chanc of the public system go bust in the long run and then afterward thei could clean up okai thi sort of contradict what i said higher up but it s anoth possibl thei d have an ad bonu when argu against govern involv in their industri as thei could then point to it failur instead of just cite theoret principl
