subject clinton press avail with russian press the white hous offic of the press secretari vancouv british columbia for immedi releas april press confer by the presid with russian press canada place vancouv british columbia p m pdt q i had two question for both presid so you could probabl answer for bori too laughter the presid i ll give you my answer then i ll give you yeltsin s answer laughter q the first is that thi is the meet of the presid so the monei that s be promis is govern monei and natur it s go to be distribut through the govern but you ve indic that three quarter ar go to be go to busi so the question is how the russian busi themselv ar go to be consult if ever what ar the prioriti becaus there ar sever associ of russian businessmen exist alreadi so will thei be invit to particip in set up prioriti for invest thi is the first and second to you we know that poll public poll in america do not show that american ar veri enthusiast about give thi aid like newsweek poll sai that about percent don t approv it and new york time publish that percent support if it just prevent civil war percent if it foster democrat reform and onli percent if it just person support yeltsin how ar you go to sort of handl thi problem that american themselv ar not veri enthusiast thank you q i have a question i m sorri is there go to be a translat of everyth into russian no just the answer just the answer okai the presid the answer to the first question is it depend on what kind of aid we re discuss for exampl the fund that will be set up for financ new busi will obvious go to those busi who appli and who seem to be good risk and make the applic the privat fund will be us to support the privat of exist public enterpris then there ar some other gener fund in the democraci corp and other thing which peopl in russia will have some influenc over the distribut of with regard to your second question let me sai that i would think that there would be peopl in both countri who would not feel too warmli toward simpli the american govern give monei to the russian govern there s opposit to that in russia and in our countri throughout our whole histori there ha been an opposit to foreign aid of all kind that is thi ha noth to do with russia if you look at the whole histori of america ani kind of aid program ha alwai been unpopular what i have tri to tell the american peopl is is thi is not an aid program thi is an invest program that thi is an invest in our futur we spent trillion trillion on armament on soldier and other invest becaus of the cold war now with a democrat govern in russia with the newli independ state the remaind of them work on a democraci and struggl to get their economi go it seem to me veri much in our interest to make it possibl to do whatev we can for democraci to surviv for the economi of russia to grow becaus of the potenti for trade and invest there and for us to continu the effort to reduc nuclear weapon and other element of hostil on both side on our side and on the russian side so i don t see thi as an aid program thi is an invest for the unit state thi is veri much in the interest of the unit state the thing i announc todai the second stage of the program which i hope to put togeth next week in my view ar thing that ar good for my countri and for the taxpay and worker of my countri russia is a veri great nation that need some partnership now some common endeavor with other peopl who share her goal but it would be a great mistak for anyon to view thi as some sort of just a chariti or an aid issu that s not what it is it s an invest for america and it s a wonder invest like all invest there is some risk but there s far less risk with a far greater potenti of return than the trillion we spent look at each other across the barrier of the cold war q mr presid first of all thank you veri much inde for come here and talk to us in the memori of the live correspond thi is the first time an american presid is do thi to the russian press corp so it s kind of a veri measur breakthrough i have two question on in your introductori remark of the other press confer you mention in brief that you discuss the start ii and start i issu could you tell us did you reach an agreement with presid yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have ukrain join the ratif of start i and the npt regim and my second question is how confid you ar that the unit state congress would be eager to support you in lift jackson vanik and other restrict inherit from the cold war presid clinton first we discuss the issu of ukrain with regard to start i and npt and gener with regard to the need to proce to have the other independ state all be non nuclear but also to have the unit state develop strong relationship with them we know that on thing that we could do that would increas i think the willing of the ukrain to support thi direct is to successfulli conclud our own negoti on highli enrich uranium becaus that would provid not onli an import econom opportun for russia but also for ukrain and it would show some reach out on our part but we agre that basic the peopl who sign off on the lisbon protocol have got to honor what thei did and we agre to continu to press that i myself have spent a good deal of time try to reassur ukrain s leader specif the presid and the foreign minist that i want strong ti with ukrain that the unit state veri much want a good relationship with ukrain but that in order to do what we need to do togeth to strengthen the economi of ukrain and to have the unit state be fulli support the commit to ratifi start i and to join the npt regim is critic what wa the second question the presid with regard to jackson vanik and cocom i would make two point first i have agre with the republican and democrat leader in the congress that we will as soon as i return have a list of all the legisl and other restrict some of them ar regulatori in natur impos on relat between the unit state and russia that ar legaci of the cold war and we will see whether thei re how mani of them we could agre to do awai with right now at least among the leadership of the congress with regard to jackson vanik i think there will be an open to chang the law if the congress is convinc there ar in fact no more refusnik no more peopl who wish to emigr who ar not be allow to if the fact is that there is no on there who would have been who the law wa design to affect then i think that the desir to keep the law will be much less with regard to cocom my guess is and it s noth more than a guess that the leadership of congress and inde my own advis might prefer to see some sort of phase movement out of the cocom regim but i think thei would be will to begin it in the fairli near futur q mr clinton when i read your speech in annapoli i got the impress that you have a complet differ person and i stress that person not polit approach toward russia compar to the approach of mr bush could you formul in a few word what is the differ between you as a person and your approach the differ between your approach to russia and the approach of mr bush and who made you why did you cite akhmatova in the last part of your speech the presid let me sai first i do not wish to compar myself with presid bush or anyon els i can t sai what wa in hi heart about russia i can sai that sinc i wa a boi i have been person fascin with the histori the music and the cultur and the literatur of russia i have been thrill by russian music sinc i wa a seriou student of music for more than year now i have read
