the presid about the job and stimulu packag thei final talk about that yesterdai afternoon at the close of that discuss thei said that thei would have anoth talk last night which thei did when the senat wa up in new hampshir and although there were no specif compromis made on either side thei did sai that thei would continu to have some discuss and that s where we ar q well who is give in where is it stand ar both make concess mr stephanopoulo i don t know that it s at that phase no compromis ha been made as the presid ha said consist he intend to come forward with an adjust packag he believ in the packag but he believ that if it s go to take adjust to get the minor to releas it he s will to make those adjust q on the subject of a vat mr stephanopoulo oh boi q can we stai on thi for on more minut mr stephanopoulo sure q we have a problem with the five minut q i know no decis have been made but what would lead the health group to believ that a vat might be necessari mr stephanopoulo sorri andrea i m not go to go down that road no decis have been made as the presid said thi morn a number of group a number of member of congress a number of other organ have recommend that thi be look at the work group is look at it but no decis have been made q to follow have thei done that directli through him have labor and busi group been in touch with the presid about it mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledg although there s a lot of peopl who have public decis in support of the vat but the presid ha not made a decis q at the meet that he s had with hi own task forc advis have thei discuss the fund issu and what the possibl option would be mr stephanopoulo i don t think that that ha been present for a decis no q not for a decis but ha it been discuss as an option mr stephanopoulo again there ar a lot of level of brief i do not believ that the vat ha been present to the presid as okai thi is someth for you to decid on q you re not sai he didn t know it wa be consid though ar you mr stephanopoulo no he said it s be consid q he knew that q but ha he discuss that with hi advis that s what i m ask mr stephanopoulo the presid ha said it s be consid i do not know what level of discuss there ha been over the vat it is someth the work group ar look at i don t even know that it s q but he didn t sai he wa consid did he at thi stage mr stephanopoulo no he is not i think we re get into someth of a metaphys debat right here what is consid q well he is the on who said i haven t review it mr stephanopoulo that is true that is what i just repeat q georg is there ani concern here that as a result of the definit statement he made in februari and the promis that if it were to be consid he d let us know and have it trickl out the wai it did that there mai now be the develop of a credibl gap on thi issu and other mr stephanopoulo i don t think so i mean it is now public knowledg that thi is be consid q is he or you at all embarrass about the absolut statement that were made from thi platform to the effect that it wa off the tabl and wa not be consid and then to have it come out not from you peopl but mr stephanopoulo well wait a second it came out from the administr what ar you talk about q what i m sai is though that the presid said he would let us know mr stephanopoulo right q you peopl then said you said i believ that it s not go to be on the program mr stephanopoulo on march th q on march th mr stephanopoulo circumst chang q well i understand but we have to find that out by root around in the fine print of an interview mr stephanopoulo root around i know you did do a veri good job there to read the usa todai articl but thi is laughter the deputi director of the omb and the secretari of health and human servic i mean that is common anytim you gui write a stori that ha an unattribut quot from somebodi in the clinton administr the headlin is i ll look at it right here and ap stori clinton want more monei for spy q what about hi remark that if it were be consid he d tell us about it mr stephanopoulo and the administr s concern and he d let you know q and did he mr stephanopoulo ye absolut what did he sai thi morn q it had to be drag out of you here yesterdai mr stephanopoulo it didn t have to be drag out of me we had the deputi director of the omb we had the secretari of health of human servic sai it wa be consid that is hi administr that is hi administr polici q were these author trial balloon or were thei orchestr leak i mean what wa the mr stephanopoulo thei were ask question thei answer the question q you re sai here that it didn t have to be drag out that you more or less made it clear yesterdai you were consid it mr stephanopoulo absolut i wa veri clear painfulli clear q wa there a particular polit strategi in make it clear the administr is consid a new tax increas on tax dai mr stephanopoulo no it wa just thi issu is be consid thei were ask if it wa be consid thei answer that it wa be consid q georg the new york time q why do it yesterdai mr stephanopoulo thei were ask q the new york time report todai that secretari reich and the chief economist at the labor depart us appl and orang number in order to portrai last month s unemploy figur in a wai that wa support of the presid s job stimulu bill but which turn out to be total fals mr stephanopoulo i don t know if it wa total fals but i think laughter the chief economist at the labor depart did grant that it wa an inappropri mix and thei sai that q the question is is the presid concern about behavior that amount to corrupt govern data and what s he do about it if so mr stephanopoulo the chief economist ha said that a mistak wa made it won t happen again and that s the end of the matter q isn t that the same inform that goe to the presid q if i could go back to the stimulu packag mr stephanopoulo there s two separ piec of inform i think that s where the confus wa q when did you all first learn about thi mistak that wa made mr stephanopoulo i read the articl thi morn q and as far as you know is the presid awar of it mr stephanopoulo i think so q and wa he awar of it befor he read about it in the new york time mr stephanopoulo i don t know not to my knowledg q did you ever hear about it befor thi morn anyth mr stephanopoulo i didn t q wasn t the presid given an erron spin on thi for hi own purpos for hi speech for hi argument mr stephanopoulo well again i m not sure both statement ar true what the labor depart ha grant is that mix them in on sentenc essenti wa mislead thei said it wa a mistak thei said thei wouldn t do it again q did thei drop it is thi someth that you choos to spin or make an issu of mr stephanopoulo whenev fewer peopl ar out of work we re gratifi but that doesn t take awai from the need to get thi job packag go q if i could go back to the stimulu packag for a minut you said that the presid plan to come forward with an amend is the timet still what it wa that the amend would be laid down on mondai and vote on on tuesdai or did he in the convers with dole talk about the possibl of put that off for a few more dai to give more time for the discuss mr stephanopoulo i think at thi point there s no chang in the schedul at all i don t know that thei discuss the time like that q do you believ that you re closer or get closer thi week than you were last week mr stephanopoulo again i believ that we re go to pass a job packag the presid is prepar to make adjust in order to get that to happen i don t know where the vote ar on clotur at thi particular time i don t know what s go to happen until we have a vote but the presid believ deepli in thi job packag and want to get it done q ha there been ani indic that thi situat ha chang mr stephanopoulo we re go to continu to work on it we ll know when the vote ar taken q georg last week you said that there ar or variou peopl in the administr were sai that you couldn t go through dole you were go to have to try and go around him becaus he wa immov on thi subject of a compromis or at least the compromis he want wa not anyth like the on that you could accept thi week you re talk to him is that becaus you ve realiz that the peel off effort wasn t go to work mr stephanopoulo that s becaus senat dole want to talk to the presid about the stimulu packag q he initi the convers mr stephanopoulo ye q secretari reich thi morn said that in fact the presid is not will to compromis on thi bill at all you sai he s make mr stephanopoulo i don t know that that s exactli what he said i think he said he didn t have ani indic that there wa ani compromis yet or that there would be a compromis and the presid doesn t want to compromis and the presid doesn t want to compromis but if he ha to make adjust to get it through he will q offici here yesterdai said that panetta wa work on a seri of adjust that might be made public befor the actual vote mr stephanopoulo it s possibl q todai mr stephanopoulo i m not sure exactli when that will happen but i think that it s veri possibl that we ll come forward with some sort of a differ packag or senat democrat will come forward with some sort of a differ packag in order to get it pass q as we understood hi convers with dole the first on wa some discuss of thi and i ll get back to you tonight with some detail or some adjust or whatev the phrase is did he offer him some detail or some adjust mr stephanopoulo i think it s a question of how detail i mean i think thei had a gener discuss about the packag last night subsequ to their convers yesterdai afternoon i believ that there will be follow up discuss todai in the senat not necessarili between the presid and senat dole and let me just reiter neither side ha made specif compromis at thi date when we have someth we ll let you know and i m not suggest that senat dole ha accept anyth that we ve talk about or that we ve offer anyth in a hard wai q what ar the follow up discuss if not the presid and dole mr stephanopoulo i think senat mitchel is go to talk to senat dole q is that a threat laughter q did the presid sai to senat dole all right how about thi number as an overal size or did dole sai to the presid i can go as high as thi did thei talk number mr stephanopoulo i don t think it wa a negoti in that respect it wa more of a discuss about their posit q did thei discuss actual number mr stephanopoulo i m just not sure i know thei talk about the basic outlin of the packag i think thei talk about the program thei care about i don t know if thei got to the level of thi mani x billion dollar q doe dole have to sign off befor there is a packag mr stephanopoulo no of cours not q did the white hous have anyth to do with the protest who show up in new hampshir todai where senat dole wa speak wa that in ani wai organ by mr stephanopoulo not to my knowledg no q and ha the presid been in touch with senat kohl or feingold mr stephanopoulo i don t think he s talk to them no q georg is the presid consid the more palat fact of have a nation sale tax instead of have the have have to continu pai for the have not and is he go to scrap hi propos tax on the privileg few with the have have to pai for the have not mr stephanopoulo the presid believ deepli that the tax rate on upper incom american as he present in hi budget should go up and i think for the second half of your question i ll refer you to my brief from yesterdai q georg on the subject of accuraci in inform you suggest the other dai that the stimulu packag includ monei that would solv the water problem in milwauke appar that is not true it s actual wast water monei mr stephanopoulo it s wast water monei for wisconsin and some could go to milwauke q but it would not affect the drink water problem becaus it s wast water monei right mr stephanopoulo it would affect the water treatment overal q but the implic from your statement the other dai wa that it would help fix thi diseas problem in milwauke now would you agre that s not the case mr stephanopoulo i m not sure of the specif i know that it goe to the overal water treatment in wisconsin q a leftov question from thi morn which wa when did the presid find out that the task forc wa deliber on a vat mr stephanopoulo i m not sure exactli when i just don t know i assum it came up over the last certainli between the time that we had comment on in the past and two dai ago q so sometim sinc march th mr stephanopoulo i think that s right i don t know the exact date q georg the presid thi morn mention that some labor and busi group ar for the vat tax appar the nation associ of manufactur talk about perhap the vat tax be okai if it replac the btu tax so doe the presid feel that perhap thi might be in place of some other tax he s propos or is thi total in addit to the other tax he s alreadi propos mr stephanopoulo i think we ve said all we have to sai about the vat at thi point i mean there s just no thi is be consid by the health care work group and that is all the presid hasn t made ani further decis beyond that q but it would be to financ health care it wouldn t be to replac some other tax that financ it wouldn t replac the incom tax for instanc mr stephanopoulo there have been no discuss on that q in term of get a vat tax through congress senat dole s press releas todai said vat on tax dai do you think doe it have a chanc of get through congress would it have a chanc mr stephanopoulo i have no idea q is that a consider whether you all put it forward mr stephanopoulo that would becom a consider if the presid were to decid to do it it s not in consider now q you said at the begin of the brief that circumst had chang and that had caus the vat to now be under consider mr stephanopoulo ye what the presid refer to thi morn these group came forward and said thi is someth that ha to be consid q those ar the circumst that have chang that s the onli differ between now and when he emphat rule it out that group have ask it to be consid mr stephanopoulo that s what he said q is that true mr stephanopoulo ye q wa there in fact some understand that sin tax would not produc enough monei for the health care benefit mr stephanopoulo i m not go to get into the deliber q but georg mr stephanopoulo no what the consider is as the presid said group came forward and said thi is someth you ought to consid the work group ar look at it q is that the onli thing that s chang sinc hi prior statement and your prior statement on the vat mr stephanopoulo ye q can you explain how those group how that inform got to him that group want it wa it just read the newspap or did group make present mr stephanopoulo i think the group as you know the health care task forc ha met with dozen of group q but thi is the presid s knowledg that these group had come forward mr stephanopoulo i think he wa refer to what wa come to the work group obvious there have also been publish posit in the newspap q have certain group brief him on the group s present to them mr stephanopoulo i don t know if thei ve brief him i mean how detail the brief have been i know that the work group decid to look into thi after be press by these group q what kind of argument did the group make that were persuas enough that the presid would chang the posit that he had enunci previous mr stephanopoulo i don t know it s just thei ve had longstand posit that thi would be a good wai to financ health care q the presid wasn t awar of those longstand posit mr stephanopoulo he mai have been at some level obvious he s been a governor for a long time and he know the basic argument for and against a vat tax q what we re try to figur out here you re tell us that the onli chang the onli thing that affect thi chang in the presid s attitud toward the vat between februari and now mr stephanopoulo the presid s attitud hasn t necessarili chang i mean he ha not made a decis q i know but the presid said that it wa off the tabl so did you and you re sai that the onli thing that s chang is the posit of these group except you re also describ them as longstand posit i don t see the chang if these group haven t had ani chang in their posit that s been made to the presid mr stephanopoulo well thei ve made the present to the health care task forc q there s no relationship at all between the fact that sin tax that he had said suggest in februari that he favor will not produc enough revenu to financ mr stephanopoulo i don t think he ever suggest that thei would produc all the revenu q well he suggest that he thought that those were appropri wai to financ health care mr stephanopoulo he did sai that i don t know that he said anyth to refut that q but in fact ha the task forc discov that there wouldn t be enough revenu from those tax to financ the kind of core benefit mr stephanopoulo again i don t think that the task forc ever suggest that there would q georg if he advoc a vat tax would that break hi promis not to rais tax on the middl class to pai for hi program mr stephanopoulo i can t comment on a hypothet situat q but doe that promis would that promis not to rais tax on the middl class to pai for the program prevent him from seek a vat tax mr stephanopoulo the presid ha made no decis on the vat tax when he doe we ll tell you and we ll explain the implic then q which specif group can you cite busi labor or otherwis whose recommend to the health care task forc ha prompt thi consider mr stephanopoulo i don t have the specif i just don t have that q georg can you tell us to what extend these other altern for instanc the employ tax or the sin tax or other financ option ar also still on the tabl and what these option ar mr stephanopoulo no as member of the task forc and repres of the work group have said thei ar look at a wide varieti of option i think that ira magazin said that there ar differ option under consider but i m not go to comment q what s the scope mr stephanopoulo i m just not go to comment on them no q what s the scope of the need how much ar you talk about that ha to be produc by on or a combin of the mr stephanopoulo that s what the health care task forc is look at q sinc there s not go to be ani brief on the miyazawa visit two question on gener what doe the presid hope to us that meet for but more specif is hi task complic by the japanes anger over the vancouv note and the remark about market access at the press confer mr stephanopoulo the vancouv note q doe no mean ye q ye and no mr stephanopoulo well i don t know i saw the prime minist s press confer where he wa ask the question about that note and he gave a veri graciou and complet answer when he wa ask the question the question of trade ar someth that certainli will be discuss between the prime minist and the presid there is obvious a trade imbal between japan and the u s that we want to do someth about q also in those comment the prime minist made he suggest that the unit state should come down heavi on him in term of trade ar you go to oblig mr stephanopoulo i think the presid will state our view on trade veri clearli and our view on the trade deficit veri clearli i don t necessarili want to agre with your character of the prime minist s comment q that we need specif export target specif numer target is that what he s go to discuss with miyazawa mr stephanopoulo thei re go to have a broad discuss of a wide rang of trade issu i don t want to get into those specif until after the meet q why q that s the crux of the issu right whether or not doe the presid believ that without specif numer target it is realli as he said in hi press confer sort of hopeless that thi is go to chang veri much mr stephanopoulo the presid believ that we must have pressur on japan to turn the trade imbal around i do not want to get into the specif of how that would be done q but doe the presid believ that their stimulu packag announc yesterdai will rectifi the imbal mr stephanopoulo i think first the presid want to get a full brief on the stimulu packag from prime minist miyazawa himself and then he ll make the comment on it q how about the russian aid packag there seem to be some confus about how the u s view that secretari christoph sai or bentsen sai the japanes mai need to do more the japanes sai that that s not what thei heard mr stephanopoulo again we re go to continu to work with all our alli in the g and we re go to continu to press for help for russian reform russian democrat reform and i think that so far we had a veri good announc out of tokyo and we re go to continu to work with our alli for bilater packag q do you think the japanes need to do more mr stephanopoulo we re go to continu to work with all our alli to do as much as we can q secretari christoph wa ask todai on the todai show thi morn what he thought of margaret thatcher s comment on the bosnia polici and he said it s a rather emot respons mr stephanopoulo over an emot issu q right to an emot problem doe the white hous condon that kind of remark mr stephanopoulo i think that secretari christoph s remark speak for itself the presid believ also that thi is a deepli troubl situat that we re try to find answer for q but that specif rather emot respons specif term mr stephanopoulo no it speak for itself q in connect with that doesn t it seem that with the number of peopl who ar be kill at thi veri moment is it good american polici to put off some decis that might be made now to help bori yeltsin win a referendum mr stephanopoulo for exampl q to take stronger action to take militari action air strike anyth that can be done mr stephanopoulo the presid believ that what must be done now is to push harder for sanction he is also as you know the administr ha been discuss lift the arm embargo he believ those ar the appropri wai to increas pressur at thi time q what is your respons to the critic who would sai that the u s is now stymi by try to help bori yeltsin retain the presid mr stephanopoulo thei re wrong we re press hard for the serb to come to the negoti tabl we re press hard for increas sanction and we re talk to our alli about the arm embargo q you were put great store in vanc and owen get peopl to agre to that now vanc and owen have both said that militari forc to some extent would be accept doe that chang your think mr stephanopoulo clearli we re go to listen to whatev peopl who have put so much time into a situat have to sai but at thi point the presid is move forward on sanction and talk about the arm embargo q a follow up on a dee dee comment thi morn she said she would be abl to provid some administr offici who could document the effect the sanction ar have in bosnia ar you go to be abl to do that or do you have anyth mr stephanopoulo i don t think that s what she said q that s exactli what she said mr stephanopoulo i don t think that s true but what she said we would look into the situat of what kind of evid can be provid in bosnia obvious if there ar connect between the bosnian serb and the serb in belgrad and we ar tighten the screw on the serb in belgrad that will have an effect over time i do not know dai by dai minut by minut what kind of help is be given between the two and what the exact effect ha been but clearli we ar slow the shipment of good into belgrad we ar have an effect on the serb there what kind of effect that will eventu have on the bosnian serb i don t know but on thing i would sai is if it were have no effect at all i don t know why thei d be fight it so much q ar the first ladi s tax return go to be releas mr stephanopoulo i think there s a joint tax return and it will be probabl later todai q is the presid consid sign an execut order ban discrimin against homosexu in the feder work forc as part of the gai right march here next week mr stephanopoulo i don t think there s ani propos for that at thi time not that i know of q it s someth that the presid promis dure the campaign that he would do mr stephanopoulo i have not seen ani i don t think it s anyth that s on hi plate right now q is he meet with gai right leader at ani point on thi issu mr stephanopoulo i don t know about on thi issu i assum that he ll meet with repres of the gai and lesbian commun sometim soon as he meet with repres of lot of differ group and commun q do you know if that s schedul mr stephanopoulo it s probabl go to be tomorrow q probabl go to be tomorrow laughter q it s a good thing you ask q who s probabl go to be there laughter mr stephanopoulo i don t know q how long mr stephanopoulo i don t know that s

major speech next week of some kind is that go to happen do you know mr stephanopoulo i don t know if thei ve ask but i think the presid ha alwai plan as he did last year to give a speech on earth dai and i expect that he will if it s not exactli on earth dai it might be a dai befor or someth like that q is he plan to sign or announc the sign of the biodivers treati in connect with earth dai mr stephanopoulo again i don t know the specif time of someth like that but it s certainli someth under discuss and someth we ve been work on q campaign financ reform mr stephanopoulo we re work on it q do you think it will be next week mr stephanopoulo i m just not sure q the biodivers treati is someth you re work on i miss the question mr stephanopoulo ye someth we re work on he ask if it wa readi

made the gai meet public right mr stephanopoulo i m certain if we had the meet i don t know about open to the press but we would have told you about it q i mean becaus it is as far as i can tell the first time in histori a presid ha met in the oval offic with mr stephanopoulo i didn t sai it wa go to be in the oval offic laughter but i didn t i m not sai that it s not but i didn t sai that it wa laughter q at the white hous in the bush administr gai offici were invit to a bill sign ceremoni and the white hous had to repudi have done that so i just want to make sure mr stephanopoulo well the

import thing wa he had a full account for american pow and mia he will obvious look into the circumst surround thi new document the presid stress that he want the fullest possibl account and said that onli when we have that can we even consid ani chang in our polici toward vietnam he ll be look at vietnam s respons to the question rais by the document and he ll also look into investig on discrep case increas effort on remain implement trilater investig and access to militari archiv and ambassador toon also brief the presid on the activ of the joint commiss and on the document q vietnam sai it

been sai that thei think that the or so prison refer to ar in fact non american that the vietnames had captur who thei refer to as american from time to time do peopl mr stephanopoulo we don t have ani final determin we re go to wait for the complet review when we have it we ll make a judgment q i know you don t have ani final determin but given all of the intens public interest in thi do you think that that s a like possibl mr stephanopoulo i just don t want to character it in ani wai until the review is complet q georg wa there a topic schedul for the speech in boston mr stephanopoulo no q is the presid go to have a press confer tomorrow with miyazawa mr stephanopoulo i think so but i m not posit ye i expect ye q wa toon in with vessei mr stephanopoulo ye q he wa in on the meet mr stephanopoulo ye q what wa the question mr stephanopoulo wa ambassador toon in with vessei and the answer is ye q do you have ani respons to the wall street journal report thi morn the presid s distress about some of hi press clip and that perhap he s distress with you about that mr stephanopoulo no well i do have a respons i think the articl wa highli mislead to the extent that it impli that the presid ha had restrict access to the press i would point out that he s answer question on occas more than ani of hi predecessor i would also point out it also q how mani question mr stephanopoulo three hundr fifti eight on occas q how mani were while he wa jog mr stephanopoulo well no that s actual a veri good question andrea and i would point out further that the articl also impli that these question were onli answer at tightli control photo opportun which is just patent fals he s had press confer in either the east room the oval offic or the roosevelt room or the brief room in addit to question taken at photo opportun and that is onli the q oval offic press confer when wa that mr stephanopoulo he s answer question in the east room he s had five in the east room he s had on in the oval offic he s had on in the rose garden he s had on or two in the roosevelt room and thi is just to the white hous washington press corp in addit to that he s had interview with local televis anchor he s met with the editori board of the portland oregonian he s had an hour long interview with dan rather he s had interview with local press from california florida and connecticut q can you address the question of the attitud the articl impli that he doesn t q why doesn t he like us laughter q did you realli get blame for that post stori q the stori is that you ar you held respons for it mr stephanopoulo i don t think i m go to comment about thi q ar you deni that the presid ha shown displeasur publicli mr stephanopoulo i am not comment on the discuss between the presid and myself q did the presid write that letter to chri webber mr stephanopoulo what q the letter to the univers of michigan basketbal player mr stephanopoulo oh ye q that is an authent letter mr stephanopoulo ye q sinc the presid first talk about the vat in februari he said at the time that he thought there probabl should be except made in basic necess such as food and cloth doe he still hold
