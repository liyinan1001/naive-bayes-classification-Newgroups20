origin plan there wasn t meant to be anyth much for the feder govern to do except keep the british out that s also untru but at least we re wander a littl closer toward realiti that the articl of confeder fell apart is enough proof it wa there for just a tad bit more well ye and no the federalist paper ar propaganda and it is therefor difficult to determin precis what maddison etc were up to from them there ar a coupl of wai to look at them on is we want you to support thi constitut so we ll sai anyth that we think will appeal to you or the more straightforward thi is why we think what we ve suggest in thi constitut is a good idea you clearli consid the former to be the primari situat thei certainli emphasis a limit role for the feder govern but thi wa not necessarili their true posit well i know hamilton wa a dy in the wool monarchist and probabl the authoritarian extrem to jefferson s democrat impul but what would you suggest as a mean of determin their opinion on the govern if we don t consid what thei wrote about the govern and is write in support of someth automat propoganda to the point we must assum it is untru or that thei ar sai what thei don t believ and like the hous of lord which it is copi from it wa given pretti wide power unfortun thei start to us them and thu the gridlock set in i wasn t awar the hous of lord had wide power i wa under the impress is wa pretti powerless compar to the hous of common and certainli didn t have almost equal their power the senat is restrict onli that it mai not introduc bill relat to rais revenu the senat wa less power than the hous of lord in the period in question if the senat wa less power than the hous of lord than we d almost have to state that the hous of repres wa also in fact thei both were becaus the british govern had much greater power than did the american system my read of the constitut and other write give me absolut no reason to believ the senat wasn t intend to make us of their law make power in fact grid lock appear to have been design into the system with the senat be a more delib bodi to act as a check on the more often elect hous the system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it end up a bit too slow i disagre the system is not too slow it wa simpli design to handl less than it ha demand that it handl as somebodi in washington put it whose name i forget congress ha becom everybodi s citi council congress is more than capabl of quick action and ha more than enough power and time on it hand if it confin itself to what it origin jurisidict wa and allow more local autonomi it is not a case of the system of govern thei creat fail but that it is oper under a set of condit thei specif want to avoid name a concentr of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduc the power of either hous in some attempt to greas the wheel all you ll get then is a system which move quicker to do stupid thing it would make more sens to make more decis at a local level on what basi do you suggest that the senat wa suppos to be some sort of rubber stamp for the hous you ll note that while the presid s veto mai be over ridden the hous can t do anyth about a veto by the senat the presiden t veto wa meant to be entir separ until bush abus it in a quit extraordinari manner it wa us more in accord with the intent of be a check on unreason legisl pleas explain to me how bush abus the veto in an extraordinari manner the veto wa clearli regard as a complet last gasp measur it us wa meant to be restrict to prevent the legislatur interf with the action of the execut i fail to see where ani restrict impli or otherwis were place on the veto it could just as easili have been read as a mean to put a check on democrat popular but unwis in the execut s opinion polici there is no limit in the constitut to the presid s veto power regard what a bill is for previou presid have us the veto for ani number of reason most usual have someth to do with their agenda i am realli curiou how you singl bush out as the presid who abus veto the senat is not meant to be exactli a rubber stamp bodi it is meant as a check on unrestrain legisl that is the extra measur built into the constitut in favour of the statu quo of the repres of the state is not a reason restrict why is it not a reason restrict becaus senat is the magic holi number upon which law must be base if senat feel safe enough with their state constitu to stand up and fillibust isn t that enough to indic there s a suffici question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re evalu it why on earth should be suffici to enact a law which cover million peopl in veri veri divers place and live in radic differ condit why shouldn t a super major be requir ani system in which the simpl major is given absolut power to ignor the minor then the minor will be ignor i do not see thi as a posit thing and for all that i m sure the republican ar look for pork as much as the democrat thei ve got some legitim object to the legisl in question david veal univ of tenn div of cont educ info servic group pa utkvm utk edu i still rememb the wai you laugh the dai your push me
