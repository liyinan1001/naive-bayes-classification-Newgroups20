subject re eight myth about nation health insur pt ii v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case write gld cunixb cc columbia edu gari l dare write i heard about a gui in alberta who came down with some rare ey diseas that he had to take repeat trip to seattl to get treat well what american privat insur plan cover travel expens well it wasn t just the travel expens it wa the whole treatment when you bui insur where you live it is base on the local rate tourist come from sai utah will find that there is a differ in what their insur will cover fob provo and what thei get stuck with at lenox hill or mount sinai if thei fall ill in the big appl but to what extent doe it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessari in the first place it s worth think about it s regular practic in a hospit to figur out who need to get at what facil don t american have to arrang in advanc for oper too i think that there ar two standard be appli here and that canada can t give beverli hill style treatment to everybodi it s not a big brother list it s more like call around town for a tabl for dinner but american need far less advanc time to book oper it would depend on where you live downtown toronto or mile british columbia just like cheyenn wy vs boston ma again geographi rear it ugli head sinc our health care provid ar privat thei depend on an adequ market size in order to sustain enough busi sinc our health care profession have equival take home pai to their american cousin it s not that thei re be paid too littl to provid servic whether canadian would be thrill at the prospect of their own health servic cater toward american who would be will to pai more than thei do is anoth issu entir it must be note that thei said thei were do it partli becaus their grant from the provinc were get smaller if those grant ar so insubstanti why the need to attract foreign to make up the differ you answer the question yourself privat nonprofit foundat have to make monei somehow and i think that it s about time that thei act like the privat hospit that thei ar person i m fed up with canadian socialist try to tell everyon that their health care is free when we ar actual bui insur that s on at you bob rae true but i wa think doe can anybodi compet with the provinc to offer basic health coverag i rememb read that that sort of privat health insur is actual illeg in canada i have onli hear american sai that it s illeg but i could be wrong just have never heard it from a canadian sourc our privat insur ha recent balk in quebec when the liber propos privat some aspect of routin care also our insur wa put in place when no ndp labour govern were in power in ani provinc to derail the effort co thei want real social medicin you re not bui insur so much as be coerc into on insur plan no it is option as it is option for doctor to accept it there ar isol relig commun in particular that ask for exempt and on e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verifi for me that it is inde neg option i guess that you can argu that there is a right to have a particular insur but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pain to keep tab with new from home and that turn the privat insur offer the frill into an effect cartel thei don t realli need to compet becaus as you put it thei re in a win win situat and thei re guarante to turn a profit believ me thei probabl had orgasm when thei figur that out and accord to my sister the yuppi thei pat themselv on the back to the point of ungraci at chamber of commerc luncheon interest side note have ani new insur compani start up from scratch sinc medicar becam standard in canada i actual have doubt that ani new on have emerg sinc ww i no scratch that there ar a few in western canada and quit a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracl out with the nation in with the french capit la group de cooper ant built a new tower by the eaton s store at le terrac and if you were abl to catch urban angel on cb s crimetim you d see it as the well lit on with doubl turret at the top as for ontario which still domin and anchor busi up north canada is a veri old monei kind of place and the free trade agreement saw a lot of odd allianc labour union and establish old monei who want to preserv their tradit monopoli on on side and entrepreneur and internation orient busi and profession on the other the final trudeau administr and the first mulronei govern had a high percentag of nouveaux rich who knew what it wa like to make your own monei and that motiv the mcdonald commiss under trudeau which set up brian s initi macaroni wa against free trade til he did a head count of hi caucu after the elect it s not realli insur if you don t have altern well you have to realiz that in our societi that s like sai that it s not realli nation defenc becaus you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opt out as a pacifist btw there ar alwai pacifist in the new argu about their portion of tax but never peopl argu over health insur altern and we re talk about a press that is hostil to whomev is in govern regardless of parti on of their few redeem characterist it seem also in the april globe and mail there wa a letter from the director of trauma servic at st michael s hospit in toronto respond to an articl on a studi compar heart surgeri in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worri that american analyst would seiz on the result as proof that canada ration vital servic the doctor i can t recal hi name said that canada is ration vital servic as ani physician can plainli see he said that a system in which peopl ar refus treatment becaus thei can t afford it is no differ from a system in which peopl ar refus treatment becaus the govern can t afford it as a result of deliber underfund of the health insur plan in fair he did sai that both the us and canadian system ar in the same situat the onli wai to hit at the canadian system is transient period of high demand which is more a function of the doctor monopoli s tight fist on the licenc an obviou differ is that in such a transient period the ration is of the natur of a mob battl over cabbag patch doll tm as we ve seen recent as oppos by ration by abil to pai but the former is a transient situat and if a larg bodi of insur patient were to delug the california health infrastructur the same would result ration among the insur popul with smaller market there is much less flexibl when deal with our insur popul than california which by the wai ha rd more peopl than canada in a much more dens area so he is correct in that the resourc ar fix for a particular time window or as a function of the doctor monopoli licenc accord to the market steadi state in either case as for be refus treatment the govern of the dai would be shred to tatter if someth like that were to happen canadian can be geograph bad too not realiz that their health care is privat while onli their insur isn t too mani peopl have bought into socialist trype that we have social medicin i know i know the monopoli power of canadian doctor often lead them to overst the problem with the system in order to get more monei from the govern anoth case of businessmen onc scratch becom socialist right as i ve point out abov but hasn t that just shift the locu of the problem from on place to the other it hasn t realli solv it either wai the transient situat ar hard to deal with sinc the chang in the privat medic care resourc take place at a slower rate than the abil of peopl to fall sick esp in the light of disast e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart diseas a doctor need year of train plu internship and specialti train peopl too often tend to put prescript cold medicin on their insur when thei realli don t need to that s why i ve argu for deduct and copay rather than educ which is what most canadian fiscal conserv ar argu for the leftist ah just let em spend yeah right also note that onli a few provinc cover prescript under some high dollar threshold in most it s your privat insur that cover it just like in the u s still it all add up in the oecd measur in fact buffalo mai be the onli place in the us where peopl get don cherri joke we get the sabr feed as a replac game on espn tonight the devil local metro ny coverag supplant the main espn game the ndp clean up a tori spend mess and just when i thought i understood canadian polit yeah it s a sad stori and saskatchewan tori leader grant devin ha been on a nonstop pr campaign to save hi sorri butt the sask ndp have taken a neo conserv turn like hawk gonzalez and mitterand did ha anybodi consid follow singapor s exampl and go to a system where the compani and the state bui basic and catastroph coverag for everybodi and then you also have an ira sort of thing to which you and your employ can can contribut for medic expens onli it would tend to discourag you from overus it the medic ira would have limit us as you d need a lower catastroph threshold els there d still be a drain on the public purs if someon exhaust their ira also singapor ha a much more autocrat mental which ha seap down into it mass if singaporean that i ve met ar ani indic i don t mean ani disprespect here where thei d let you just die on of the good thing about be the last countri to creat a nation health care system should we decid to is that we have everybodi els s mistak to learn from that s true the question is how much leewai is there between the u s approach and the second most capitalist approach of canada franc and germani serious there ar few area that have suffici popul for a two more tier system like what the french have a health polici prof d g shea ha cite studi in the nejm that indic have a popul of is necessari for adequ competit and in canada there ar onli four citi west of the great lake with that popul or larger but there ar mani citi in the us with that kind of popul ye mani and pretti close to a lot of smaller town or not too far from a bigger town just take a look at a detail atla or better take a flight from pittsburgh or rochest to toronto my first time across lake ontario to nyc i wa amaz by the increas in densiti and the toronto region is the densest in all of canada there wa on about a group of doctor in calgari who have open canada s first us style mri clinic as an altern to the provinci own on it s about time i ve rag on my own doctor friend as to why thei don t invest in their own privat practic in the end it s their monei but thei choos to spend it on america s cup pipedream and that s none of my busi as for provinci own for sure it s against the law in canada for govern to be directli involv in the provis of health care except in the militari or nativ reser vation what that term actual mean is that the facil get by on public grant to meet shortfal from lack of us no kid medic practic itself is much more conserv up north my own best friend did two clerkship at the mayo clinic in rochest mn and is no stranger to high tech medicin but hi boat come first there were some peopl express concern that it wa the first wedg of two tier health care and that it might violat the canada health act no it s probabl socialist whiner who ar offend that we have privat practic and alwai have thei can all take cash anywai so why not have a particular facil the canadian big govern mental often imagin govern where it doe not even exist sinc the french and german have becom more entrepreneuri and less laidback without sacrif their cultur and valu then canadian can do the same as i ve point out abov the law state that it is illeg for the govern to provid ani health servic except for the militari and nativ look nobodi stop the clinic when thei plan on the mri nobodi stop them when thei bought it nobodi seem to be stop them from us it either much ado about noth thank good that hockei playoff have start while it seem current unjustifi there wa on anecdot told by the head of the partnership to demonstr the mri he show an imag of an injur knee which happen to belong to the manag of the bank who approv the loan he said that without it the gui might have had to wait a month or more at the provinci mri then anoth length of time for treatment after which the muscl would have atrophi and rehabilit would have been that much harder if that isn t the first whiff of two tier i don t know what is i m certain there is exagger somewher becaus the gao studi of canada cite often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i ll bet the doctor is reli on peopl have listen to american trash talk on cabl so that he can puff hi chest a bit there ar alreadi a few treatment regimen for knee injuri without reli on mri unfortun i ve had a few and i m not a banker gld je me souvien gari l
