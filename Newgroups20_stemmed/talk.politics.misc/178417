n wh izv dscomsa desi de hallam dscomsa desi de phill hallam baker write or ar thei simpli propogranda we can t know what phill realli mean becaus he s obvious us argument design to convinc i make no secret of what i am up to i have state explicitli in post that i am a polit propagandist on numer occas anyon post to thi group who is not probabl ha the wrong group for exampl i have on numer occas state quit clearli that i beleiv that certain faction of the gun lobbi ar the worst possibl advoc of their caus and i am prepar to do anyth in my power to provid them with a platform becaus thei can convinc peopl far better than i could hope that mani peopl with a fixat on lethal weapon ar danger and derrang if you happen to know a polit posit which doe not have peopl advoc it who do more harm than good pleas point it out some peopl have even accus me of invent such advoc pure for the purpos of have them trash a set of polit view in fact thi would be a futil tactic becaus i could never hope to invent a charact as danger as sybok athena edu a man who i quit serious believ to be mentali ill and a potenti psychopath unfortun the local sherif offic have inform me that thei ar unabl to act until he attack someon on of the advantag and draw back of requir proof on the part of the govern befor thei mai take action against citizen and part of the reason some of us believ weapon should be avail so if you were to ask me what is the point that i am try to make from thi current argument on the absolut sanctiti of the us constitut what would i answer we ar not argu the absolut sanctiti of the u s constitut in fact the fillibust we re talk about isn t in the constitut i object to your suggest that the senat wasn t intend to exercis the power it wa clearli given firstli i see that the current us polit scene like the uk polit scene ha becom ti to special interest rather than chase the conveni caricatur put about by the media and polititian themselv for thi gai right cmapaign environmentalist zionist i e jew foreign lobbyist whatev vote power thei have etc i sugest that you look at who is realli benefit the inevit conclus is that it is the major corpor own by the ultra wealthi that have benefit regan and bush creat what can onli be describ as a welfar state for the rich i ll point out again that reagan onli had a republican major in the senat dure hi first term and hi coalit in the hous came apart at about the same time bush never had ani real support in congress the real point is that everybodi everywher got their pork from the big corpor to the gui i saw last night leav a conveni store with an arm of junk food he d bought with food stamp he spent more in food stamp on junk than i make in a week and i m not on govern assit monei wa divert from program address social need and pour into the weapon industri in the form of cost plu profit contract lesse let s pull out the old almanac in total u s govern budget outlai were billion dollar in est thei were trillion dollar an increas of approx billion dollar in nation defens cost billion dollar in it wa billion dollar and increas of billion dollar that leav an increas of billion dollar unaccount for thi repres an increas of in incom secur which includ retir program hous assit and unemploy benefit and i believ welfar cost billion dollar in it wa billion dollar or more than nation defens start thi repres an increas of in the feder govern spent billion dollar on medicar in thei spent billion dollar an increas of in the fed spent billion dollar on hous credit and subsidi of that like in it wa billion in health care servic and research wa billion dollar in it wa billion dollar agricultur up billion to billion scienc up billion to billion resourc conserv up billion to billion educ up billion to billion veteran benefit up billion to billion trasnport up billion to billion about the onli thing i see which wa serious decreas wa under the energi categori primarili under suppli and commun develop in the area of disast relief and between the two of them repres a loss of less than billion dollar where wa thi huge divers in order to rectifi thi situat there must be constitut revis not that s a stretch if the current govern wa push by the presid to creat thi mess wouldn t on expect it to begin to equal onc the pressur is gone secondli the form of thi revis must take account of the chang circumsatnc of the role of the feder govern onli assum that the new role is a posit role we want to continu i see veri littl posit about it the constitut cannot be us to frustrat the democrat process the constitut wa design to frustrat the democrat process so that the voter could be absolut sure thei were get what thei want by the time it happen nor do i see put the brake on the democrat process an inher bad thing califronia s ride the edg and everi time thei pull their ballot initi nonsens it get wors if the peoplr want to have welfar spend by the feder govern thei will have it sometim or perhap most of the time the peopl should be told no and point to their local govern attempt to prevent thi through constitut trickeri onli lead to the constitut be brought into disreput phill would you do me the veri great favor of repeat that in talk polit gun method will alwai be found to bypass such provis and onc the govern get us to bypass those provis thei will bypass the other up to the first ammend cute we can elimin violat of the law by elimin the law thi is a major reason why the right to own gun should be exclud the implic that thi right is equal to the right to free speech is danger free speech alon is danger phill peopl know that mass ownership of lethal weapon caus thousand of murder a year the danger conclus thei mai reach is that the first ammend mai also be the same danger mistak ok phill all you gotta show me is a clear pattern of reduct in homicid rate across sever countri and that ll be it not current mind you reduct note howev that thi is not the slipperi slope argument it is becaus the right freedom of speech ha been chain to the privileg to own weaponri that the danger aris the advoc of thi pivileg must not be allow to chain freedom of speech to their caus such that if thei fall freedom of speech fall as well such action ar not the action of peopl genuin interest in freedom who s chain anyth to freedom of speech by call it a freedom thirdli and most importantli i want to discov a mechan wherbi i can engend intellectu debat as oppos to totem debat i consid the grave threat to civilis to be the loss of the abil to reason about the polit debat at anyth other than the superfici level the object i rais to your base your case entir on the assert of the supremaci of the us constitut is that the currenc of your argument is limit to the currenc of the totem upon which it is base the danger of totem is that thei can be reinterpret in differ wai by differ peopl phill you re a master of subtli chang the subject i haven t base my argument against raw democraci on the constitut i ve tri to explain why it isn t a good idea the onli time i ve refer to the constitut is to point out it doesn t contain the restrict on the veto and the senat you appear to believ were meant but just didn t make it in there the constitut doesn t contain the fillibust rule i onli believ that the rule is a good idea you cn t dismiss that as vener the constitut becaus it isn t in the constitut david veal univ of tenn div of cont educ info servic group pa utkvm utk edu i still rememb the wai you laugh the dai your push me down the elev shaft i m
