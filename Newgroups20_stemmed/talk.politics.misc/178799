subject re law and econom i m go to be mix togeth here stuff from two of ted frank s articl apr midwai uchicago edu which wa a respons to me and apr midwai uchicago edu a respons to tim smith ye i know the boomer court didn t call it emin domain but if it walk like emin domain and swim like emin domain and quack like emin domain wdstarr ar all tort case realli emin domain case then what about bankruptci contract emin domain is a state mandat transact in which on parti is requir to sell a piec of properti which it own to anoth parti regardless of whether the first parti wish to sell at all at a price which is set by the state i fail to see how thi doctrin can be found in tort bankruptci or contract case in gener well okai sort of in bankruptci if so so what sinc when ar the court suppos to be in the busi of prevent parti from reap windfal settlement from other parti when those settlement aris from wrong act by those other parti wdstarr sinc you said that boomer s relianc on econom led to an unjust result i m point out that your altern is far more unjust in the tradit sens of the world atlant cement s act wa not wrong it did someth that we as a capitalist societi should want them to do build a factori creat industri and job the cost of complianc wa grossli disproportion to the damag face by plaintiff bang here s on of the place where we wide diverg you believ that the court in decid a civil disput between two parti should consid as a factor perhap as an overrid factor issu which i believ the court should ignor as be irrelev to the disput boomer v atlant cement co wa an action brought by on parti boomer whose properti right were be violat on an ongo basi by anoth parti the atlant cement compani the fact support boomer s content that atlant cement wa wrongfulli damag hi properti and boomer ask the court to order atlant cement to stop do so end of stori there wa no reason for the court to consid such issu as what a capitalist societi would want atlant cement to do or whether the cost of complianc wa disproportion to the damag face by the plaintiff those issu had noth to do with the case befor the court bill if the govern had step in and the epa made a regul requir multi million dollar cement plant to be shut down becaus of a smatter of cement dust at a cost benefit ratio of you d be up in arm why is it okai for the judici branch to interfer thi wai but not the legisl or execut branch i d be up in arm why do you assum that quit the contrari i d probabl support the action sinc it would be base on the same gener doctrin as the decis that i believ would have been correct in boomer the idea that peopl s properti right should not be violat for reason of econom effici in boomer it wa boomer s properti right which i believ the court should have protect in the hypothet epa rule you ve present it s the american peopl s collect properti right in a healthi physic environ what good is cost benefit ratio of if you wind up with cement dust in your air your rule make it per se illeg to ever oper a cement plant if the state of massachusett came up with a similar regul you d be up in arm and complain about interfer with properti right and fifth amend violat onc again why is it okai for the judici branch to interfer thi wai but not the legisl or execut branch or ar you not the libertarian you present yourself as be ted frank how would it be per se illeg to oper a cement plant wouldn t it just mean that when bui land for a cement plant you would have to either bui enough land so that most of the pollut would stai on your land or bui pollut easement from the surround landown tim smith all it take is on holdout out of hundr of neighbor to scrap the plant furthermor each of the neighbor is go to want the full benefit of the bargain under the result bilater monopoli a bonanza for lawyer to be sure who get to negoti each of these agreement a windfal for homeown who can extort awai ani profit the plant would make but not particularli good for societi ye so what the court ar suppos to protect the specif right of individu not the gener interest of some nebul societi if societi can have it cement plant without violat anyon s right fine otherwis societi will somehow have to limp along with on less cement plant see ted i realli am a libertarian after all that s the whole point behind the coas theorem in a world without transact cost the land will automat be put to the best us as it is transfer from person to person instantan without friction the legal regim will not matter becaus the result will be the same in a world such as our on with transact cost on want the legal regim to approxim the end result to begin with in order to minim the transact cost on want the legal regim to approxim the end result to begin with in order to minim the transact cost which on ar you speak of i want the legal regim to protect peopl s right besid coas s theorem onli ha real applic in the never never land of perfectli ration actor in the real world some peopl ar go to be stubborn orneri spite or otherwis irrat from a econom point of view and the purpos of the court is to protect their right to be so i don t care if you can show me logic that your cattl ar onli do of damag to my properti per head so i should ration sell you graze right to my land for sai per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain don t want ani damn cattl on my properti not at ani price and then you sai everyon s properti right were protect the plaintiff were made whole unnecessari settlement cost were avoid as abov i disput your claim that the plaintiff were made whole thei were in fact by court action depriv of their right as owner of properti to choos to sell or not sell that properti at a price accept to them wdstarr then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole becaus the award of damag in involuntari why should we treat a nuisanc plaintiff ani differ than ani other tort plaintiff we don t requir specif perform in the analog contractu situat why in tort last question first for the same reason as in contract law becaus to do so would come danger close to tread on the thirteenth amend as to your then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole becaus the award of damag in involuntari claim you re at least partial right face with situat in which the wrong ha alreadi been done and the damag to the victim ha alreadi taken place and cannot be revers or undon court will try to set an equit price tag on the loss suffer by the victim and requir the wrongdoer to pai thi price rather than an inflat price which the victim might prefer in these case the sale ha alreadi taken place and is irrevers and the court simpli tri to ensur that a fair price is paid under the doctrin that a onli in certain circumst should even a civil wrongdoer be forc to pai punit or excess price and b even a genuin victim should not profit in an unjustifi or inequit manner from hi victimhood both of these doctrin mai be worth discuss or debat elsewher but neither is relev to case like boomer in which the wrong act and the loss stem from it ar still in the futur and can be revers undon i e prevent from happen at all by order of the court in these type of case all the court ha to do is requir that the potenti victim s properti right ar protect until and unless he agre to sell them at a mutual accept price there is no need for the court to guess at the equit valu of the loss and forc both side to accept it find it can leav that oper up to the parti themselv and again i ask sinc when ar the court suppos to be in the busi of ensur that unnecessari settlement cost ar avoid if so i ve been miseduc i alwai thought that the court were suppos to be in the busi of ensur that justic is done unnecessari settlement cost ar unjust becaus thei ar punit in case like boomer thei re simpli a cost of do busi the fact that the proprietor of the atlant cement co got themselv into a posit in which thei found themselv over thi barrel is simpli a result of their own poor busi decis to start up a cement plant without first try to negoti with boomer and everyon els whose properti right thei d be violat via the oper of their plant there s noth punit or unjust about it it is complet sensibl onli if you believ that the alleg right of the owner of atlant cement to stai in busi and avoid lose a lot of their own monei due to their own wrong act and the alleg right of sever hundr atlant cement employe to not have their job disappear should trump the right of peopl who own properti which wa damag by atlant cement s wrong act wdstarr anybodi who ever commit a wrong act should disgorg their entir set of possess to wrong person weren t you complain about excess punit damag befor anybodi who want to commit a wrong act in the futur should be requir to bui the right to do so from the victim in advanc and the seller should be allow to set hi or her price for the privileg no injustic no punit damag you d like posner bill he s a libertarian realli i didn t know that what if anyth ha he had to sai about case like boomer wdstarr in eal he cite it as an exampl of bilater monopoli that the court correctli avoid i m sure it cover in the land and posner book on tort law presum favor but i don t have that book in front of me doesn t sound veri much like a libertarian to me libertarian tend to believ in the right of individu peopl not societi i ve admit that my understand of the field gener refer to as law and econom is weak if it advoc the us of econom analysi as on of mani tie breaker factor which court mai us to help them reach decis in case in which the disput as measur by the scale of justic is evenli balanc fine but as illustr by boomer it is not fine when the court start view the econom of a case as be more import than the justic of a case wdstarr in thi case the justic of the case wa intric ti up with the econom of the case atlant cement commit a tort caus k of damag should it pai in the million or just compens for the damag it commit as state abov the tort wa ongo atlant cement want to be abl to continu to violat boomer s right while the court mai have been justifi in set an equit price tag on the damag alreadi commit it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the futur violat of boomer s right and to then forc boomer to sell at that price
