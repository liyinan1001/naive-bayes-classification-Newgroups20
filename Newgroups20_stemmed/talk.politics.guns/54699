ask at ani investig into the batf s and fbi s particip at the waco fiasco in hope of be resolv and hopefulli wake up the local new media that thei ar not get the entir truth from the batf and fbi my list is up to that ar realli nag at my gut the list will probabl grow what were the content of the origin warrant now seal that the batf obtain it is reason to believ that illeg firearm and or ammunit could not be flush down the toilet therefor a no knock raid could be rule out prior to the initi assault on the complex did a singl batf agent and accompani wit without a conting of assault and new media personnel attempt to knock on the door of the branch davidian s complex and serv the warrant in a manner prescrib by law on the dai of the initi assault on the complex batf agent were awar that sever small children were insid the build in the ensu gun battl batf agent fire into a build known to contain children kill at least on two year old child know children were present why didn t the batf have an altern plan and immedi retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the altern plan rather than open fire and jeopard the live of the children in the build the fbi spokesman state that paper evid indic that david koresh and member of the branch davidian possess over in firearm and ammunit did david koresh and the member of the branch davidian have a valid feder firearm licens were thei activ particip in the legal busi of sell bui firearm and ammunit and were ani of the weapon thei had illeg possess doe thi paper evid consist onli of weapon purchas or doe it includ legal dispossess weapon after the origin assault on the compound tragic fail a batf spokeswoman state we were outgun yet tv newscast of video tape film at the time of the incid show batf agent arm with mp and ar m rifl although unclear on the video tape becaus of obstruct from full view by agent s bodi thei also mai have had ak and sk rifl what type s of firearm did the batf agent have immedi access to at the scene of the origin assault on the complex sinc there is no evid to confirm anyon wa insid the complex involuntarili why did the fbi treat it as a hostag situat along the same line why did the fbi us psycholog warfar techniqu includ sensori overload sleep depriv and other disrupt techniqu that would test the saniti of ani normal person rather than us techniqu aim at place the complex occup into a calmer frame of mind report indic sever of the children insid the complex were accompani by their mother sinc it is reason to expect these mother would have their children taken awai from them if thei came out why did the fbi expect the mother to just walk out and surrend themselv to the author agent at the scene claim to have seen member of the branch davidian set fire to the complex branch davidian member who surviv the inferno claim the fire wa start when an armor vehicl punch through the wall and knock over a lantern which wa set on a tabl video tape of the incid doe show an armor vehicl punch a hole in the wall and the fire erupt almost immedi from the same gener locat wa the sourc of the fire the same room where the armor vehicl penetr fbi spokesmen ar voic the opinion that the david koresh and the member of the branch davidian commit mass suicid yet bodi ar be discov throughout the hous and other area within the build complex thi seem to be counter to ani known mass suicid through histori what evid doe the fbi have that a mass suicid pact exist fbi director session state that the massiv firebal shown on the video tape wa caus by the branch davidian s ammunit and or powder cach explod yet the firebal seem to be more characterist of the type creat when compress ga or other highli volatil fuel sourc explod wa ani evid found which would indic the branch davidian had an ammunit and or powder cach which explod to creat thi firebal if so and if david koresh and member of the branch davidian were engag in the legal busi of sell bui firearm wa the amount determin to be excess greater than on would expect for someon engag in such a legal busi it is rumor that on fbi agent wa extrem upset about critic new media coverag and intention us an armor vehicl to crush a report s car which had been left at the compound is there ani factual basi to thi rumor and if so what charg will be brought against the fbi agent who perform the act fbi director session state that dure the final assault on the complex over shot were fire at the vehicl on the video tape of the incid you can hear the drone of the armor vehicl engin yet there is no sound of the sharp report that on would expect to hear if shot were fire also there ar no indic of smoke and or muzzl flash appear from the window build or other structur in the video sure these should be evid if the branch davidian had fire on the armor vehicl final the video tape doe not show ani indic of paint splatter spark or other characterist sprai of materi which should be appar if the branch davidian had fire upon the vehicl do ani of the armor vehicl which were brought in to pump tear ga into the compound show evid of fresh damag due to be hit by shot from high power rifl cs ga is consid to be a chemic warfar agent the unit state ha sign intern treati which prevent the us of cs ga in warfar if the unit state could not moral us cs ga against saddam hussein and hi troop why is it moral accept
