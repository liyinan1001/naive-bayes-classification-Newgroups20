subject vancouv seattl studi critiqu open letter by dr paul h blackman research coordin for nra ila nra offici journal dear sir by now we ar us to the new england journal of medicin s public of small scale studi relat to firearm from which conclus ar drawn which ar quantum leap from the data follow by announc of momentu scientif find these ar regularli releas to the press without the caveat which riddl the conclusori paragraph and often accompani by an editori call attent to the find gener while thei at least present a few interest data howev meaningless the studi misinterpret statist and ignor or belittl seriou studi by criminologist the latest effort handgun regul crime assault and homicid a tale of two citi by j h sloan et al with the accompani editori firearm injuri a call for scienc by two employe of the center for diseas control novemb howev is an insult to the intellig of ani seriou scholar in ani field and have so few data and so mani flaw that i feel compel to write at some length to call attent to variou major and minor fail in no particular order the author misleadingli cite wright et al ref to support the statement that some have argu that restrict access to handgun could substanti reduc our annual rate of homicid wright et al in fact studi and reject that content the author pretend that vancouv and seattl ar veri similar citi with similar econom circumst histori demograph characterist and the like in fact the citi ar veri differ with veri differ demograph characterist which appear to explain complet the higher homicid rate in seattl both citi ar over three forth non hispan white and the non hispan white homicid rate ar report to be the same in seattl and vancouv it is the differ back ground problem circumst and behavior of the variou ethnic minor which explain the differ in homicid the author pretend thei ar evalu canada s gun law compar to washington state s but thei do not examin at all the situat in vancouv prior to the gun law take effect in as it happen in the three year prior to that vancouv averag homicid per year on eighth involv handgun ref and in the seven year of the nejm articl there were homicid per year on eigth involv handgun sure even the medic profess recogn that on must look to see the prior situat wa befor conclud that a chang made a differ would a physician conclud that a patient wa benefit from eat oat bran muffin each dai for seven year becaus hi cholesterol level wa without at least see if it wa befor he start the regimen the author pick two medium size citi to evalu a nation gun law noth can be learn from such a tini and arbitrarili select sampl seattl appear to have been select becaus it wa convieni for the author rather than for ani scientif reason would physician call someth a scientif studi which involv on experiment subject and on dissimilar control had differ arbitrarili select citi been chosen opposit scientif conclus would follow vancouv s homicid rate exce that of such wild west citi in texa as el paso corpu christi austen and in colorado colorado spring ref the author fail to clearli demonstr that firearm or handgun ar far more commonli own in seattl than in vancouv thei us two surrog approach in pretend to studi the avail of firearm handgun the first is an appl and orang effort to compar the number of carri permit in seattl to the number of regist handgun in vancouv but the number clearli underst the number of handgun in seattl and count primarili protect handgun owner the second howev tell noth about the number of handgun in vancouv and count non protect handgun for the most part where is it difficult to obtain handgun legal for protect registr figur ar meaningless there ar regist handgun in new york citi new york daili new sept compar the two that method suggest about handgun per popul in new york citi compar to in vancouv mean vancouv ha a greater preval of weapon than new york citi the second method of measur gun densiti is cook s gun preval index a previous valid measur of interc differ but the valid wa by cook of hi own theori ref normal second opinion ar sought from a differ doctor more significantli the cook index is base on the averag of the percentag of firearm involv in suicid and homicid so the author ar basic take a measur of misus unsurprisingli gun misus in homicid in seattl in vancouv is relat to gun misus in homicid plu suicid divid by two in seattl in vancouv the author ar not measur the rel avail abil of firearm or of handgun in seattl and vancouv the author misstat the law of both washington and canada thei neglect to mention the signific fact that washington ha a wait period and background check prior to the purchas of a handgun and that provis exist in canadian law for own and carri handgun for person protect the author also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legal in canada than is actual the case the author ignor all other factor which might explain the differ in crime rate beyond some vagu mention of the penal provid by law and the roughest of estim of clearenc for on particular offens homicid involv a firearm there is no measur of the differ in the number of law enforc offic their aggress in make arrest for gun law violat in the two jurisdict arrest rate for other offens convict rate actual sentenc impos for gun relat crime violent crime without gun or gun law violat or incarcer rate wherea social scientist would attempt to measur and hold for such differ the author of the nejm tale of two citi fail even to mention most factor relat to crime control the author dismiss claim that handgun ar an effect mean for protect unless the crimin is kill such is not the case criminologist ref have found that almost american annual us handgun for protect from crimin and that us a gun for protect reduc the liklihood that a crime rape robberi assault will be complet by the crimin and reduc the likelihood of injuri to the victim it is interest nonetheless that the author report the same number four of civilian justifi homicid without firearm in each citi but that less restrict seattl account for of the report civilian justifi homicid involv firearm the center for diseas control which fund the studi editori prais the paper ref sai it appli scientif method to examin a focu of content betweeb advoc of stricter regul of firearm particularli handgun there is noth in the paper which could possibl be mistaken for scientif method by a sociologist or criminologist the vancouv seattl studi is the equivol of test an experiment drug to control hypertens by find two ordinari look middl class white male on ag and the other and without first take their vital sign administ the experiment drug to the year old while give the year old a placebo then take their blood pressur and on find the younger man had a lower blood pressur announc in a special articl a new medic breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a studi would neither be fund by the cdc or print by the nejm sinc the longstand anti gun bias of the nejm and the cdc make them will to present shoddi research as scientif breakthrough in special articl and editori relat to firearm we ar oblig

like a bikini what thei real is suggest but what thei conceal is vital the problem is demonstr by the most recent entri in a long line of scientif research purport to show a causal link between gun avail and homicid fund by the feder govern and publish last year in the new england journal of medicin the studi compar homicid rate in seattl and vancouv and suggest that a handgun ban mai reduc the rate of homicid in a commun the nine medic doctor who publish handgun regul crime assault and homicid essenti reason in three step despit mani histor social and demograph similar vancouv ha a markedli lower homicid rate becaus it stricter gun regul make gun less avail the second step in their reason seem indisput the overal homicid rate in seattl for the period wa per popuat compar with in vancouv homicid is definit more common in seattl the question then becom why the author present a believ although not entir accur case to support the notion as claim in the third step of their reason that vancouv s handgun regul ar much more stringent but their evid on the differ in gun availabilti is indirect and unpersuas inde thei acknowledg that direct evid on the point doe not exist thei offer two fragment of inferenti data in support of the claim that gun ar more avail in seattl but for all anybodi know as a matter of empir fact the opposit could be true we ar therefor be ask at the conclus of the studi to believ that a differ in gun avail explain the differ in homicid rate when a differ in gun avail ha not itself been establish inde the situat is even more troublesom the first of the two indirect bit of evid is a differ between the number of conceal weapon permit issu in seattl and the number of restrict weapon permit issu in vancouv differ between the two citi in the permit regul render these two number strictli noncompar the second bit of evid is cook s gun preval index which stand at percent for seattl but onli percent for vancouv cook s index howev doe not measur the rel preval of gun ownership in variou citi it measur gun misus it is an averag of the percentag of homicid and suicid involv firearm in the present case the index show onli that in homicid and suicid firearm ar more like to be us in seatt than in vancouv to take cook s index as a measur of gener firearm avail it must be assum that the proport involv of gun in homicid and suicid is directli relat to their rel avail in the gener popul but thi is exactli what the author ar seek to prove to assum what on is seek to prove then to prove it on the basi of that assumpt doe ot constitut scientif evid for anyth even if we were to grant on the basi of no compel evid that gun ar less common in vancouv we might still question what caus what the author attribut seattl s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership but it might well be argu that low crime or homicid rate reduc the motiv for averag citizen to obtain gun in other word that crime rate explain the variat in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it wa onc commonli argu that great britain s low rate of violent crime wa a function of that nation s strict gun law and the consequ low rate of gun ownership until british research colin greenwood found that great britain had enjoi low rate of violent crime for mani decad befor strict firearm control were enact to invok an ancient methodolog saw correl is not caus nor do the problem with thi studi end with it lack of direct data on gun ownership the author sai seattl and vancouv ar similar in mani wai impli that thei differ mainli in gun avail gun law stringenc and crime rate thi is an evid attempt to establish the ceteri paribu condit of a sound scientif analysi that all els is equal among thing be compar clearli the two citi ar similar in some wai but a closer look reveal differ in wai that ar relev to their respect crime or homicid rate the citi ar close match in what percentag of their popul is white percent and percent but seattl is about percent black while vancouv is less than percent vancouv s minor popul is overwhelmingli asian so although the author show that th two citi ar approxim compar on a half dozen readili avail demograph indic thei have not shown that all potenti relev sourc of variat have been rule out in fact the differ in racial composit of the two citi is particularli relev in light of the studi s breakdown of homicid rate accord to the race of the victim for the white major the homicid rate ar nearli ident per in seattl in vancouv the differ overal homicid rate in the two citi ar therefor due entir to vastli differ rate among racial minor for black the observ differ in homicid rate is to and for hispan to methodolig complex render the asian comparison problemat but it too is higher in seattl than in vancouv racial minor ar much more like to be the victim of homicid in seattl than in vancouv the white major is equal like to be slain in either citi sinc the nearli initi differ in homicid reat between the citi is due exclus to or differ between minor group it is fair to ask why postul differ in gun avail or gun law strigenc would matter so dramat to minor but not matter at all to white can differenti gun avail explain why black and hispan but not white ar so much more like to be kill in seattl than in vancouv studi in the unit state incident do not show larg or consist racial differ in gun ownership or ar other explan more plausibl could the dispar between canadian and american rate of poverti among racial minor have anyth to do with it what ar the rel rate of drug or alcohol abus of homeless among each cty s minor popul the citi of seattl run the largest shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemploy among young central citi nonwhit men in the unit state usual exce percent what is the compar canadian percentag the crucial point is that canada and the unit state differ in mani wai as do citi and popul subgroup with the two countri absent more detail analysi nearli ani of these mani wai might explain part or all of the differ in homicid rate in gross comparison such as those between seattl and vancouv all els is not equal the author of thi studi acknowledg that racial pattern in homicid result in a complex pictur thei do not acknowledg that the ensu complex serious undercut the main thrust of their argument thei also acknowledg that socio econom statu is probabl an import confound factor in our comparison remark further that black in vancouv had a slightli higher mean incom in than the rest of vancouv s popul given the evid present in the articl it is possibl that all of the differ in homicid rate between seattl and vancouv result from greater proverti among seattl s racial minor but the author pai no further attent to thi possibl sinc detail inform about household incom accord to race is not avail for vancouv the larg insurmount methodolog difficulti confront in gross compar studi of thi sort can be illustr with as simpl exampl if on were to take all u s couti and compar them in term of perval of gun ownership and crime or homicid rate on would find an astonish pattern counti with more gun have less crime would on conclud from thi evid alon that gun actual reduc crime or would on insist that other variabl also be taken into account in thi exampl the hidden variabl is citi size gun ar more common in small town and rural area wherea crime is a big citi problem if research fail to anticip thi variabl or lack the appropri data to examin it possibl consequ thei coud be veri serious misl in the studi at hand the author match two citi for size but not for minor poverti rate or other hidden variabl and their result ar imposs to interpret in the editori firearm injuri a call for scienc accompani the studi two offici from the center for diseas control laud the author for appli scientif method to a problem of grave public heath signific but in attempt to draw causal conclus from nonexperiment research the essenc of scientif method is to anticip plausibl altern explan for the result and try to rule them out absent such effort the result mai well seem scientif but ar littl more than polem masquerad as seriou research that thi studi is
