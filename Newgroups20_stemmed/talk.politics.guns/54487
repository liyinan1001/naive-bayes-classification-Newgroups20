subject re some more about gun control first i would like to sai how much i appreci have so liter and erudit an individu as mr rutledg with whom to discuss thi topic frankli most anti rkba poster refus even to approach the topic of the origin understand of the bill of right as detail in the write of the era thi is most refresh second i must apolog for leav the discuss for sever dai my brigad s quarterli drill wa thi weekend and i need to attend to sever matter pertain to the state militia some peopl seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro nism that is out of place in the th centuri i m not sure the swiss would agre and i think perhap a discuss of how the militia both organ and unorgan fit into the defens plan of my state mississippi pleas do not assum that thi describ someth peculiar to on southern state for instanc the commonwealth of massachusett ha a well organ militia which member report maintain stock of both riot gun and machin gun the law of other state will vari but ar probabl similar titl of mississippi code defin our militia as all abl bodi citizen of the state between the ag of seventeen and sixti two year the militia is divid into class the nation guard the mississippi state guard and the unorgan militia the nation guard is a strang sort of fish from a constitut perspect it tri to be both state militia and feder reserv the discuss of thi para constitut arrang is quit interest in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of thi discuss suffic it that at thi date the nation guard ha ceas to have ani constitut stand as anyth but a feder reserv forc mississippi and most other state maintain a pure state organ militia in mississippi thi is call the state guard in other state it mai be call someth els the state guard exist as a cadr or train corp made up of mostli experienc offic and senior nco who serv as volunt without compens we drill on a monthli basi at the compani and battalion level brigad onc a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organ our state author cadr strength is thi is a skeleton of an organ without ani flesh the muscl and sinew when need will come from the unorgan militia in time of invas insurrect or calam the governor can order the activ of the state guard when thi take place a call will first be made for volunt to fill the organ out to either it conting strength of or full strength of in the event that a suffici number of peopl fail to volunt the law provid detail instruct for the conduct of a draft of the unorgan militia the size of the state guard is not specifi by law but rather by execut order at on time the organ militia of mississippi consist of regiment needless to sai the state doe not have armori brim with weapon with which to equip such a forc the histor preced for arm such a forc is by us of mostli the privat arm of the militiamen it is my hope that demonstr that state militia ar far from be the long dead anachron that some mai wish to claim no i simpl state that the peopl have a right to join a well organ militia and i have also state that a militia that meet onc or twice a year is clearli well organ and thi state of readi that i have claim the peopl have a right to is the same state of readi expect of the militia as state by hamilton regard hamilton if you take hamilton s opinion as be the sole repres of the opinion of the found father you will have chosen a highli skew sampl set hamilton wa on the extrem federalist end of the polit spectrum other such as cox and henri can be chosen to repres the other end mani contemporari felt that the idea of have a stand armi of ani sort or even a select militia or train band were contrari to the egalitarian natur of the govern ment thei were strive to perfect the compromis reach wa to provid for a small armi which had to be refinanc everi two year and iron clad protect for the militia which wa to remain ever terribl and irresist these protect includ state control not feder limit of feder util of the militia i e execut law suppress insurrect and repel invas and the right to keep and bear arm to prevent what the british had tri to do at lexington these limit eventu prove so oner to the feder govern ment that thei were skirt by the creation of the nation guard the nation guard wa creat for on veri simpl reason the constitut militia wa had prove too unreli for fight war of imperi expans e g spanish american war the constitut provid that the militia could onli be emploi by the feder govern in veri limit purpos as far back as the war of militia unit had refus to leav unit state territori to attack the enemi further there wa no constitut author for ani conscript of anyon into the feder militari and militiamen were particularli protect in all war until ww i everi american who left the countri under arm wa a volunt when the nation guard act of requir that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the armi exist soldier were grandfath at least on of these grandfath individu refus to go to franc in and hi refus wa upheld by the feder court mr rutledg ha state that the second amend appli onli to member of a well organ militia howev the pre constitut histori of the american militia show rel few period when the militia came close to meet either messr rutledg or hamilton s definit of well organ in the period of peac between the french indian war and the revolut mani compani simpli stop drill and had to be reconstitut just prior to the revolut perhap mr rutledg would care to argu that those of my ancestor who answer the lexington alarm had forfeit their right becaus their unit didn t drill for a few year in the s i would not be so bold again i wish to repeat the nation guard for all it merit is not the militia describ by the constitut nor by mr hamilton nor by mr henri nor by mr cox the fact that the feder govern and mani state ar delinqu in their attent to and organ of their constitut militia diminish neither their respons nor the right of the militia as detail in the constitut misunderstand of the natur and purpos of the militia is but on error that ha crept into modern read of the constitut the constitut prohibit state from keep troop or ship of war in time of peac i have heard some insist thi prevent state from maintain a militia but thi come about becaus peopl todai do not understand the mean of the word in their th centuri usag todai we call ani larg vessel a ship but in the th centuri the word describ a particular kind of vessel a ship is a larg vessel with three or more mast each carri squar rig sail a brig ha two mast in the contemporari usag the state were prohibit onli from keep the largest warship of the dai those capabl of global oper todai s equival might be a prohibit on the state keep nuclear missil troop at thi time meant a full time profession militari organ ani studi of contemporan write will bear thi out in at least on respect i am in agreement with mr rutledg be person involv in the mainten and advanc of the militia as a viabl mean of defens for a modern societi i am frequent both bemus and sadden when friend and associ wax poetic on their place in the unorgan militia and becom strang silent
