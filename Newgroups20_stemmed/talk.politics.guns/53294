subject re gun control wa re we re mad as hell at the tv new jim de arra jmd cube handheld com wrote last year the us suffer almost wrong or accident death by handgun alon fbi statist in the same year the uk suffer such death scotland yard statist the popul of the uk is about that of the us weight for popul the us ha x as mani handgun relat death as the uk and no the brit don t make up for thi by murder x as mani peopl with basebal bat you just can t compar thi wai all homicid must be shown per capita not just handgun the avail of them in the usa make them the prefer murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in as the favorit as a favorit sure as lethal not like a studi of violenc in chicago produc thi tabl percentag of report gun and knife attack result in death weapon death as percentag of attack knive total attack gun total attack sourc firearm and violenc in american life it might be contend that if gun murder were depriv of gun that thei would find a wai to kill as often with knive if thi were so knife attack in citi where gun were wide us in homicid would be expect to show a low fatal rate and knife attack in citi where gun were not so wide us like vancouv would show a higher fatal rate but the nat l commiss on the caus and prevent of violenc task forc analyz the data and found thi not to be the case it appear to them that as the number of knife attack increas in relat to the number of firearm attack which presum happen where gun were less avail to assail the proport of fatal knife attack did not increas rel to the proport of gun attack in fact the revers wa true what wa found wa that most homicid did not show a determin on the part of the assail to kill fatal caus by knife tend to show a singl minded on the part of the assail to do grave physic injuri multipl stab wound wound concentr about the head neck and chest etc most gun homicid did not show thi pattern rather more fatal attack were commit dure a moment of rage and not the focus intent to kill the victim sourc report on firearm and violenc then sinc england usa my ancestor left becaus of the oppress you must compar england befor strict gun law to england after strict gun law to be abl to draw ani mean at all england ha essenti legal drug so there ar no drug gang battl for turf etc there if you drop out the drug relat kill here the usa would look a whole lot more peac there ar a lot of factor which make a differ actual i m not fond of make ani kind of social parallel between european and american there ar more cultur beahvior and econom differ between us than similar i just sort of found myself back into that corner over the last coupl of week i don t think we could ever attain the low level of european violent crime here in the us whether we ban gun or requir everi law abid citizen to carri a load uzi on the other hand we can draw lesson from neighbor who ar more cultur similar name the canadian in fact an exhaust seven year studi ha alreadi been done of the respect crime rate of vancouv british columbia and seattl washington citi with roughli the same popul urban economi geographi and crime but with decidedli differ approach to gun control in seattl handgun mai be purchas legal for self defens after a dai wait period a permit can be obtain to carri a conceal weapon the recreat us of handgun is minim restrict in vancouv self defens is not consid a valid or

mai be obtain in order to transport the weapon to licens shoot club handgun transport by vehicl must be store in the trunk in a lock box in short gun control but not unreason so both citi aggress enforc their gun law convict for gun relat offens carri similar penalti the research studi all case of robberi assault simpl and aggrav burglari and homicid occur in seattl and vancouv from to in defin the case thei us the same standard the fbi s unifi crime report result dure the seven year studi the annual rate of robberi in seattl wa found to be onli slightli higher than that in vancouv burglari occur at nearli ident rate assault were record in seattl versu in vancouv the risk of be a victim of a simpl assault in seattl wa found to be onli slightli higher than vancouv and the risk of aggrav assault wa also slightli higher howev when aggrav assault were subdivid by weapon and the mechan of assault a clear pattern emerg although both citi report nearli ident rate of aggrav assault involv knive and other danger weapon firearm were far more like to be us in seattl in fact time as often over the seven year studi homicid occur in seattl per vs homicid in vancouv per after adjust for differ in ag and sex among the popul the rel risk of be a victim of homicid in seattl as compar to vancouv wa found to be when homicid were subdivid by the mechan of death the rate of homicid by knive and other weapon exclud firearm in seattl wa found to be almost ident to that in vancouv virtual all of the increas risk of death in seattl wa due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicid by firearm handgun account for roughli of homicid involv firearm handgun were time more like to be us in homicid in seattl than in vancouv the author of the report also investig legal justifi homicid self defens onli such homicid occur dure the seven year studi of which were commit by polic onli case of civilian act in self defens occurr in seattl and in vancouv onli involv firearm after exclud these case there wa virtual no impact on these earlier find thi is i feel a veri fair report on might even make the argument that it is bias against canada as a whole becaus vancouv report annual rate of homicid two to three time that of ottawa calgari and toronto while seattl report annual homicid rate onli half to two third that of nyc chicago lo angel and houston critic of handgun control alwai argu that limit legal access to handgun will have littl effect on the rate of homicid becaus person intent on kill other will onli try harder to acquir a gun or will kill by other mean thi report show differ if the rate of homicid in a commun were influenc more by the strength of intent than by the avail of weapon we could expect the rate of homicid by weapon other than gun to be higher in vancouv than in seattl howev dure the studi interv vancouv s rate of homicid by weapon other than gun wa not significantli higher than that in seattl suggest that few would be assail switch to homicid by other method as well readi access to handgun for self defens by law abid citizen wa not endors in thi report although seattl did experi a higher rate of firearm death for self defens these case account for less than of the homicid in both citi dure the cours of the studi period and as wa report seattl appar didn t enjoi relief from ani crime categori over vancouv becaus citizen mai legal arm
