subject re my gun is like my american express card thoma parsli thomasp ifi uio no write observ from a naiv norwegian yup you said it i admir such honesti gun ar made to kill peopl not to shoot target or to have someth more macho than stamp to collect fire an anschutz then come back and talk to us you re let ignor and possibl fear cloud your think either that or thi is sour grape becaus we beat you in the olymp shoot event funni you d think biathalon would be a natur sport for the nors it is more easi to kill injur someon with a gun than with a knife or a bat as in basebal precis that make them the best method of defens for the citizenri not everybodi ha the time to train with a gladiu you know but for some reason those who prei on other seem to have more free time to extend thi a bit further you need onli a certain level of compet to beat anoth with a rang weapon get in their face with a weapon and win is much more difficult and requir more train time the averag citizen just doe not have i ve spent a few year practic with a sword i can take the common person arm with on though self defens isn t the reason i own on my kid sister would have an even chanc of beat me gun vs gun with onli a month of train that make firearm much better in our ey it s not veri wise to compar two complet differ countri like usa and let s sai island on issu like crime and violenc excel point perhap you aren t so naiv after all ye the problem is peopl commit crime not the tool bee us but should be taken into concider taken into consider in what respect though quit wrong let s make it a blanket statement for weapon in gener thi ha been taken into consider we call us of them aggriv assault assault with a deadli weapon assault with intent to kill attempt murder and a whole host of other and tack on extra prison time we have a veri strict gun legisl in norwai but until recent it wa possibl for enyon over year to bui a shotgun shotgun ar us mainli for hunt in norwai but becaus it wa so easi to accuir on it wa the most us gun in crime in norwai i suspect it wa about the onli weapon avail you conquer your land among other a full millenia befor we were thought of and shortli thereaft weapon weren t quit so common i suspect that a few world war made a differ too sinc in time of emerg weapon tend to be turn in or donat to needi caus i m curiou though were the weapon us in the crime bought shortli befor the crime or were thei aquir by other mean ani requir other than just regist the shotgun and unbeliev the us of gun in crime fell there ar now a new law against wear long knive in public and why should it be allow come on down to honest erik s us sword here s a slightli us short sword the battlefield supremaci weapon of the eleventh centuri onli with trade in easi financ sorri i couldn t resist you gui still slice each other with long knive or is thi realli not a problem what i as an scandinavian have problem to understand is that you american have a more liber view on gun and violenc than on nuditi and sex try show a bare breast on tv inst of violenc and murder i m all for that what get me is that scandanavian and ye i m onli a coupl gener off the longship us to be some of the most fear warrior on the planet a mere millenia ago yet now seem to spend their time sit in spa and do a bit of topless sunbath mayb you had a bit more time and a more homogen cultur to becom civil with ye i know a littl american histori but is it a civil human right to have an assault gun in your home and or an handgun in your car ye we re too damn violent partial i believ becaus we ar not a homogen cultur and don t identifi ourselv as american first and foremost i m rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritag wherea i suspect you couldn t care less about that welsh blood in your vein thank to a raid in ireland back in the time scale and the homogen cultur ar import equal import is a basic philosoph differ in person versu collect good in america the individu is more import than the mass person liberti ar prize abov all thi is sadli chang of late but i trust you notic how thi call for freedom make law that restrict individu for littl collect benefit hate to american i d hazard a guess that were america less interest in freedom and person liberti and more interest in collect good we never would have sent our arm forc anywher on poor effect of thi cultur we have is that we re look out for ourselv and it is quit easi to identifi with onli a small segment of the popul my grandmoth tell of be discrimin against back in denmark becaus she spoke low dane wherea other spoke high dane it wa shortli after world war ii as i rememb that low dane wa abolish so there wa on common dialect we cannot fathom such a minor thing be a problem becaus we have even more obviou mean of identifi an outsid the bad english is not my fault it s probabl the keyboard softwar or the qualiti of the subtext on tv take heart your is better than of what get post by nativ speaker ani help hint for our educ system peopl have thi annoi tendenc to drop out of school and sell drug over here and what kind of name is thoma parsli here you can us my great grandfath s befor he
