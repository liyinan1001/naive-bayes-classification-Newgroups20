subject re gun bui back on thu apr gmt r vmcm csuohio edu wrote firearm ar the fifth lead caus of unintent death among children ag and under from the rkba archiv rkba total firearm death for children through at is on of the smallest caus of death in children car fall burn drown food ingest ar all much larger caus of death so firearm ar the th lead caus after drown and choke on food at least for sorri charl accord to the nation safeti council accid fact in gun accid were the fifth lead caus of accident death for children ag and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accident death is import so gun don t kill as mani children as car accid what is the differ in sever between death and death the differ is that a ration person would address the lead caus first and address the lesser caus later that think is so screw up i don t even know how to respond to it a ration person would concentr on motor vehicl death and not attempt to affect childhood fall drown gunshot injuri etc so thi so call ration person us your definit if he or she were attempt to affect the lead caus of death for adult ag through would onli worri about cancer and would not try to decreas lesser caus such as heart diseas injuri stroke suicid liver diseas chronic lung diseas homicid hiv infect or diabet oh okai charl that make a lot of sens i tell you what charl i ll call the heart foundat and suicid hotlin and tell them that thei ar not act ration and that thei can all go home becaus thei ar address the lesser caus of death and you call your local polic homicid depart liver foundat and diabet foundat and tell them to stop address these lesser caus pleas quit wast my time with thi silli shit charl i ve got an idea charl why don t you start a talk polit caraccid group or talk polit fall group thi is talk polit gun don t confus the issu just becaus a social problem mai not claim as mani victim as anoth we should not try to address it i don t agre i m not post to t p g to debat the suppos sever of caus of childhood death i am realli get frig sick of have to respond to the irrat statement of peopl who assum that someon who want to discuss youth gun violenc or unintent youth gun death is try to make a polit issu out of it i assum that ani human person would be concern when ani year old got hold of their parent gun from their bedroom drawer and accid blew awai on of their friend a human person who keep a firearm in the hous with a year old would also teach thi child how to safe handl the firearm ignor is our greatest enemi again charl you tend to confus the issu and take thing out of context for your own purpos the statement that you respond to abov is actual in refer to a previou post by anoth person who like you express concern over make youth gun violenc a prioriti i guess mayb human person and ration person could be interchang huh both would be defin as a person who onli address the social problem that caus the greatest number of childhood death if that is the case i m extrem glad that i am inhuman and irrat well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violenc what other sourc of inform do you have which confirm their data these folk ar well known for misrepres the fact perhap you can verifi their data with the uniform crime report sorri charl the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepres the fact but if you insist accord to the ucr firearm murder of youngster and under increas percent between and is the nation center for health statist good enough for you thei state that everi dai american children ag and under ar kill in gun accid suicid and homicid mani more ar wound or how about the nation pediatr trauma registri thei sai gunshot wound to children ag and under nearli doubl in major urban area between and do you also doubt the american academi of pediatr charl thei state that gunshot wound among children in urban area increas from to charl i hope you don t need to be convinc that youth ar increasingli victim of gun injuri and that thei have easi access to gun if you don t realiz thi fact i don t care if you go by cdc or fbi data or if you go into the home school and street where these kid ar and take a poll by yourself i m not go to bother to try to convinc you it obviou that you have rule out ani idea of discuss thi issu in a sane fashion and that you ar so focus on try to make thi a gun control and polit discuss i realli don t want to do that or the center for diseas control thei have firearm statist ar firearm a diseas charl it s obviou that you know noth about the cdc thei don t just studi cancer and heart diseas i ve got new for you interperson gun violenc is an epidem in surgeon gener c everett koop declar that gun violenc is as much a public health problem as cancer heart diseas or auto accid that you greatli underestim the presenc of gun in the live of youth in the live of youth or in their school i know a number of youth who have firearm present in their live is is quit appropri to teach children to safe handl firearm thi is a presenc right what ar you try to sai thi innuendo remind me of listen to bill clinton who the f k said anyth about teach children to safe handl firearm charl in the futur if you ar go to post to t p g and jump into a previou discuss pleas read the entir post not just sentenc that you decid to respond to what the hell ar you sai here you re wast time and space try to make a polit and gun control issu out of a discuss that isn t the cphv report that youth bring gun to school daili and that bring gun to school at least onc a year i wouldn t trust their statist without independ verif the cdc estim that out f high school student carri a gun to school at least onc in base on cphv statist base on ucr base on what the cdc also sai that million elementari ag latch kei children kid who come home from school to an empti hous have access to gun in their home therefor what is the purpos of thi claim charl buddi i m get realli tire of thi do you live on the planet mar as a physicist i realiz that you probabl don t come into contact with mani youth but i realli think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discov the joi of gun in school in addit spend a few minut talk to these kid ask them if thei have ever heard gunshot in their neighborhood whether thei know anyon who ha been shot whether thei know anyon who ha a gun whether thei have ever held a gun and whether thei themselv have ever been shot believ me charl that will be your independ verif rodnei w thoma r vmcm csuohio edu urban
