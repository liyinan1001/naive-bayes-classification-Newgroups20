write the second amend is a guarante of the right to bear arm clearli and unequivoc without infring unfortun the second amend is not as clear as you state if last part of it is taken along it follow what you have said the problem i have is with the first part of the singl sentenc which make up the amend the second amend is a well regul militia be necessari to the secur militia of a free state the right of the peopl to keep and bear state arm shall not be infring arm you didn t even get the capit correct try read usca on the constitut or get ani other correct version of the constitut thi mention of a well regul militia is what confus me accord to the federalist paper s a well regul militia ha a well defin structur and follow nation uniform regul perhap you should actual read the federalist paper jame madison federalist paper besid the advantag of be arm which the american possess over the peopl of almost everi other nation the exist of subordin govern to which the peopl ar attach and by which the militia offic ar appoint form a barrier against the enterpris of ambit more insurmount than ani which a simpl govern of ani form can admit of notwithstand the militari establish in the sever kingdom of europ which ar carri as far as the public resourc will bear the govern ar afraid to trust the peopl with arm jame madison i annal of congress june the right of the peopl to keep and bear arm shall not be infring a well regul militia compos of the bodi of the peopl train to arm is the best and most natur defens of a free countri alexand hamilton federalist paper on the organ of the militia littl more can reason be aim at with respect to the peopl at larg than to have them properli arm and equip and in order to see that thi be not neglect it will be necessari to assembl them onc or twice in the cours of a year alexand hamilton federalist paper speak of stand armi if circumst should at ani time oblig the govern to form an armi of ani magnitud that armi can never be formid to the liberti of the peopl while there is a larg bodi of citizen littl if at all inferior to them in disciplin and the us of arm who stand readi to defend their own right and those of their fellow citizen but sure hamilton and madison didn t mean the peopl when thei said peopl right that s why the amend refer to the right of the militia your averag year old male doe not fall into the definit you re right the militia consist of all abl bodi male and probabl femal under current interpret therefor most member of the militia the on the everi gun advoc refer to ar not member of a well organ militia and therefor ar not directli the amend doe nor refer to well organ it sai well regul i have some target you mai examin if you wish to check how well regul i am mention in the amend if thi amend want to allow everi member of the militia to keep and bear arm why did it specificli mention a well organ militia in the same sentenc as the right to keep and bear arm correct that s why the right is reserv to the peopl and that wa to insur the peopl could form a well regul militia not a well organ militia it could be argu that the first part of the sentenc is separ from the last part if so why wa it includ in the same atom unit of written what do atom unit have to do with thi argument ani moron can set h bar c instead of a separ sentenc oh i see what your question is why don t you read the federalist paper jame madison federalist paper regard the gener welfar claus noth is more natur nor common than first to us a gener phrase and then to explain and qualifi it by a recit of particular but what doe madison know about the grammat style of the nd he onli wrote it the amend also impli that the right to arm ha to due with the secur of a free state the federalist paper s mention of a well regul militia give mani exampl of how thi militia protect the secur of a free state all these exampl ar action of a veri organ forc not some john q public with a gun that s obvious becaus you ve never actual read the federalist paper all that the second amend clearli state to me is that the peopl s right to form well regul militia shall not be infring that is peopl have the right to join a well organ militia thi well organ militia will of cours provid train in how to us arm and in basic militari tactic these train member of the militia can keep and bear the arm can t read huh show me where the document sai well organ militia lastli read through the federalist paper s on well organ militia it is veri clear that mani of the reason for these militia on reason state is the protect from a stand armi these dai the stand armi could easili defeat a group consist of everi year old male and femal not in the armi forc that is exactli why everi person should be allow to own ani weapon current in us in the arm forc anoth reason state for well organ militia is to reduc the need for a stand armi well the us armi forc have been a stand armi for more than half the histori of the us but the major reason is to protect against that veri same armi it seem to me the whole reason for the second amend to give the peopl protect from the us govern by guarante that the peopl can over through the govern if necessari is a littl bit of an anachron is thi dai and ag mayb it time to re think how thi should be done and amend the constitut appropri abraham lincoln first inaugur
