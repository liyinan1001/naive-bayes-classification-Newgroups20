subject re my gun is like my american express card in articl cmm thomasp surt ifi uio no thoma parsli thomasp ifi uio no write abus by the gover thi seem to be on of the main problem ani harder gun control would just be abus by the gover either some of you ar a littl paranoid no offenc mr parsli i have to take except at thi there ar verifi previou exampl of level of u s govern abus gun control restrict i don t think it is paranoid to worri that what ha been abus in the recent past might be abus in thye futur after so mani time of get burn ani sane person will stop put hi hand on the stove or you should get a new gover you do have elect i d love to but as long as the politician grab power to sell pork back to their constitu there s not a lot i can do it s silli to suggest that if there s anyth we can t trust the govern to do and therefor the govern should be allow to do it then we should chang govern down that road li total govern power i ve never been a fan of totalitarian gun n crimin most weapon us by crimin todai ar stolen thi is veri like known crimin can not bui weapon that s on of the point of gun control and becaus gun control ar strict in whole scandinavia and most of europ we dont have ani problem with smuggl gun the north american contin is not europ no matter how mani peopl would like it to be drug ar veri illeg and thei re here for year canada ha crow about it gun control if it is necessari to control gun over the whole contin then canada should have alwai had compar rate to the u s yet thei still don t unless you can tell me why the canadian border is so much more magic than the mexican border which is shorter and far more heavili patrol then i realli can t accept that argument mix weapon and thing that can be us as on what i meant wa that car can kill but thei ar not gun no there ar approxim death due to gun in the u s two third of which ar suicid unfortun i don t have suicid rate for norwai howev thi make the per gun death rate about half the per car death rate the issu i hope i think we all agre that the crimin ar the main problem gun ar not a problem but the wai thei ar us is and what ar thei for i think thi discus is interest when you think of ex jugoslavia thei should all have weapon it s their rigth to have them and if thei us them to kill other innoc peopl the problem is human not gun the problem s been human sinc befor we had stone ax the fct of the matter is simpli thi if nobodi ever assault anybodi whether there is a weapon of ani sort around would be total irrelev yet weapon ar built i d suggest then that the murder impuls in human pre date weapon anywai the bosnian et al have been make an excel attempt to kill each other for half a thousand year take awai their gun even if we could would neither halt the kill nor reduc the brutal if of all murder wa done with ax would you impos some regul on them or just sai that thei ar ment to be us at tree and that the ax is not a problem it s the axer an exampl don t flame me just becaus not exactli ar kill by gun in the u s approxim of murder ar commit with firearm with handgun with non handgun the reason i sai that gun per se ar not the problem is that our non gun rate exce most of europ s countri entir violent crime rate i don t realli think we ve got more knive or fist in ani case i think exampl of gun control appli to the u s have been abkect failur just like drug prohibit and other form of prohibit until you deal with why peopl ar do what thei ar do you won t solv your problem and if the problem is violent crime you shouldn t concentr on the tool instead the vast major of gun is never ever misus on the order of over the entir lifetim of the gun thi sai to me that you can t make the argument that the gun itself caus the misus think about the situat in lo angel where peopl ar bui gun to protect themselv is thi a good situat the situat is not good in that peopl fear for their live but recal the scene of the store owner dure the last riot protect their shop with gun would it have been better thei too lost their livelihood is it the rigth wai to deal with the problem the problem of poverti and rage in lo angel no it isn t howev if that problem becom a violent action then ye it can be appropri whether or not some person ha been hurt by their condit won t make me less dead if thei burn down my hous with me in it you have to examin which problem you re refer to if you re discuss someon violent assault you then it is a perfectli legitim respons to make them stop hopefulli simpli let them know you re prepar to shoot them would be enough as it wa with the abov mention store owner if everybodi bui gun to protect themselv from crimin and their neighbor who have gun what do you think will happen i mean if everybodi had a gun in usa of household have some form of firearm usual a long gun that account for a level of access for at least million american firearm ownership is most like among educ well off white the group least like to be involv in violent crime you mai take that for what it s worth david veal univ of tenn div of cont educ info servic group pa utkvm utk edu i still rememb the wai you laugh the dai your push
