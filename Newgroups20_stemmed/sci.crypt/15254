subject cryptographi faq digit signatur archiv name cryptographi faq part last modifi faq for sci crypt part digit signatur and hash function thi is the seventh of ten part of the sci crypt faq the part ar mostli independ but you should read the first part befor the rest we don t have the time to send out miss part by mail so don t ask note such as kah refer to the refer list in the last part the section of thi faq ar avail via anonym ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet new answer cryptographi faq part xx the cryptographi faq is post to the newsgroup sci crypt sci answer and new answer everi dai content what is a on wai hash function what is the differ between public privat secret share etc what ar md and md what is snefru what is a on wai hash function a typic on wai hash function take a variabl length messag and produc a fix length hash given the hash it is computation imposs to find a messag with that hash in fact on can t determin ani usabl inform about a messag with that hash not even a singl bit for some on wai hash function it s also computation imposs to determin two messag which produc the same hash a on wai hash function can be privat or public just like an encrypt function here s on applic of a public on wai hash function like md or snefru most public kei signatur system ar rel slow to sign a long messag mai take longer than the user is will to wait solut comput the on wai hash of the messag and sign the hash which is short now anyon who want to verifi the signatur can do the same thing anoth name for on wai hash function is messag digest function what is the differ between public privat secret share etc there is a horrend mishmash of terminolog in the literatur for a veri small set of concept when an algorithm depend on a kei which isn t publish we call it a privat algorithm otherwis we call it a public algorithm we have encrypt function e and decrypt function d so that d e m m for ani messag m we also have hash function h and verif function v such that v m x if and onli if x h m a public kei cryptosystem ha public encrypt and privat decrypt checksum such as the applic mention in the previou question have public hash and public verif digit signatur function have privat hash and public verif onli on person can produc the hash for a messag but everyon can verifi that the hash is correct obvious when an algorithm depend on a privat kei it s meant to be unus by anyon who doesn t have the kei there s no real differ between a share kei and a privat kei a share kei isn t publish so it s privat if you encrypt data for a friend rather than for your ey onli ar you suddenli do share kei encrypt rather than privat kei encrypt no what ar md and md md and md ar messag digest function develop by ron rivest definit appear in rfc and rfc see part code is avail from ftpmd note that a transcript error wa found in the origin md draft rfc the correct algorithm should be call md a though some peopl refer to it as md what is snefru snefru is a famili of messag digest function develop by ralph merkl snefru is an round function the newest in the famili definit appear in merkl s paper me a code is avail from ftpsf
