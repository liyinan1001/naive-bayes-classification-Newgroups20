it ani wors than the current unsecur system it becom much wors of cours if the govern then us thi clinton clipper to argu for restrict on unapprov encrypt thi is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr mai in particular of cours but isn t thi kind of the domino theori when on littl countri fall it neighbor will sure follow and befor you know it we re all mine salt in siberia for not turn in our captain crunch secret decod ring i wish i could agre with you ask yourself thi why would ani privat sector entiti wish to bui a crypto system that wa known to be at least partial compromis kei escrow in thi instanc why would ani privat sector entiti wish to bui a crypto system that had not been properli evalu i e algorythm not public releas the answer seem obviou to me thei wouldn t there is other hardwar out there not compromis de as an exampl tripl de as a better on my suspicion is that the price will drop dramat on these non clipper system if not we re in troubl given that the clinton administr is not entir stupid although we d like to think so i cannot believ that thei have fail to realiz thi thei know their initi will fail much as crippl de wa never taken serious the onli wai their move can work is by coercion you know littl about polit if you don t realiz that thi is just a first step in the next move it make no sens otherwis the next move ban or severli crippl crypto not us the clipper system is easili justifi why would anyon want other encrypt unless thei were try to subvert the govern we ve provid you with a veri secur altern so us it or go to jail be fine whatev how can you reconcil the administr self proclaim purpos of provid law enforc with access to encrypt data without make the clipper system the onli crypto avail in the u s you simpli can t and the administr know it anyon who want to keep the govt out of their hair be it for drug deal or whatev would just bui still avail non clipper system don t sell our crafti clinton type short thei can t be that stupid either ban non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administr collect i q is about that of a potato why do you think at t jump on so fast thei know it s go to be big and not becaus it s better right on the face of it noon will bui the stuff that doesn t have to at t must know thi too think man why the hell would thei jump the gun my interpret andrew tim mai whose sig block mai get him bust in the new regim isn t thi just a littl melodramat i realli wonder to wit the letter i just sent to clinton the white hous offic of the press secretari c o presidenti comment line fax april sir and or madam i must object most strongli to the administr evolv posit on encrypt and cryptographi i am shock at the clinton regim increas lean toward a authoritarian approach with regard to privaci and freedom from govern oversight in dai to dai life it is appar to me that those who draft the clipper chip propos which is incident gain notorieti as the big brother propos ar either incred ignor or veri sly inde anyon knowledg in the nuanc of cryptograph develop and research must understand that a kei step in the develop of a new algorithm especi on destin for standard is the full disclosur of the algorithm to the privat and academ sector the proper evalu of an algorithm dep end on care scrutini by these sector and onli such scrutini can provid true public confid in the secur of the algorithm the assumpt that a new algorithm will be accept base on assur from expert without full disclosur is plain ignor in addit the assumpt that an algorithm will be market over other technolog such as de when it is character by kei escrow is lunaci it seem an easi step in the logic chain that probabl consum will prefer to purchas equip not crippl by govern kei escrow no matter how tamper proof the kei escrow might be i cannot believ that even the least educ polici maker would have fail to realiz these flaw i can onli assum then that the drafter of the clipper chip propos knew veri well the difficulti of sell a crippl system to the privat sector the onli wai thi propos make ani sens or ha ani chanc of succeed is in coercion even the languag of the propos make it painfulli clear that the next logic step is the outlaw of other encrypt devic and hardwar that do not uti lize the big brother chip unfortun the public at larg is not educ enough on the issu to realiz what thei ar lose i expect the big brother propos to encount littl resist from the american peopl who you will have so effici dupe onc again with pretti word like harmoni right to encrypt and voluntari it mortifi me that the phrase that seem to be us more and more often to character the clinton administr is i can t believ it s happen here more
