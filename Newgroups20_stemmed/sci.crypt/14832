subject ripem frequent note vulner archiv name ripem attack last updat mar some possibl attack on ripem thi is a live list of potenti weak to keep your ey open for when us ripem for secur electron mail it doe not go into great detail and is almost certainli not exhaust obvious mani of the weak ar weak of cryptograph secur mail in gener and will pertain to secur mail program other than ripem it is maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu it is post monthli to a varieti of new group followup pertain specif to ripem should go to alt secur ripem cryptanalysi attack break rsa would allow an attack to find out your privat kei in which case he could read ani mail encrypt to you and sign messag with your privat kei rsa is gener believ to be resist to all standard cryptanalyt techniqu even a standard kei about bit with ripem is long enough to render thi impract bar a huge invest in hardwar or a breakthrough in factor break de would allow an attack to read ani given messag sinc the messag itself is encrypt with de it would not allow an attack to claim to be you de ha onli bit in it kei and thu could conceiv be compromis by brute forc with suffici hardwar but few agenc have such monei to devot to simpli read on messag sinc each messag ha a differ de kei the work for each messag would remain high kei manag attack steal your privat kei would allow the same benefit as break rsa to safeguard it it is encrypt with a de kei which is deriv from a passphras you type in howev if an attack can get a copi of your privat keyfil and your passphras by snoop network packet tap line or whatev he could break the whole scheme the main risk is that of transfer either the passphras or the privat kei file across an untrust link so don t do that run ripem on a trust machin prefer on sit right in front of you ideal your own machin in your own home or mayb offic which nobodi els ha physic access to fool you into accept a bogu public kei for someon els could allow an oppon to deceiv you into send secret messag to him rather than to the real recipi if the enemi can fool your intend recipi as well he could re encrypt the messag with the other bogu public kei and pass them along it is import to get the proper public kei of other peopl the most common mechan for thi is finger assum the oppon ha not compromis router or daemon or such finger can be given a fair amount of trust the strongest method of kei authent is to exchang kei in person howev thi is not alwai practic have other peopl vouch for you by sign a statement contain your kei is possibl although ripem doesn t have featur for do thi as automat as pgp ripem doe gener and check md fingerprint of public kei in the kei file thei mai be exchang via a separ channel for authent playback attack even if an oppon cannot break the cryptographi an oppon could still caus difficulti for exampl suppos you send a messag with mic onli a pem mode which doe not provid disclosur protect to alic which sai ok let s do that your oppon intercept it and now resend it to bob who now ha a messag which is authent as from you tell him to do that of cours he mai interpret it in an entir differ context or your oppon could transmit the same messag to the same recipi much later figur it would be seen differ at a later time or the oppon could chang the origin name to himself regist your public kei as hi and send a messag hope the recipi will send him return mail indic perhap even quot the unknown messag to defeat playback attack the plaintext of each messag should includ some indic of the sender and recipi and a uniqu identifi typic the date a good front end script for ripem should do thi automat imho as a recipi you should be sure that the origin name header and the sender indic within the plaintext ar the same that you realli ar a recipi and that the messag is not an old on some thi also can and should be autom the author of thi faq ha made a modest attempt at autom the process of gener and check encapsul header the program ar includ in the standard distribut in the util directori local attack clearli the secur of ripem cannot be greater than the secur of the machin where the encrypt is perform for exampl under unix a super user could manag to get at your encrypt mail although it would take some plan and effort to do someth like replac the ripem execut with a trojan hors or to get a copi of the plaintext depend how it s store in addit the link between you and the machin run ripem is an extens of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remot machin which you ar connect to via network or wors yet modem an eavesdropp could see the plaintext and probabl also your passphras ripem should onli be execut on system you trust obvious in the extrem case ripem should onli be us on your own machin which you have total control over and which nobodi els ha access to which ha onli carefulli examin softwar known to be free of virus and so on howev there s a veri real trade off between conveni and secur here a more moder cautiou user might us ripem on a unix workstat where other peopl have access even root access but increas secur by keep privat kei and the static link of cours execut on a floppi disk some peopl will keep ripem on a multi user system but when dial in over an insecur line thei will download the messag to their own system and perform the ripem decrypt there howev the secur provid by such a mechan is somewhat illusori sinc you presum type your cleartext password to log in you ve just given awai the store sinc the attack can now log in as you and instal trap in your account to steal your privat kei next time you us it from a less insecur line thi will like remain the situat as long as most system us the rather quaint mechan of cleartext password authent i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefulli i manag my secur arrang in my plan next to my public kei so that potenti correspond can be awar what level of precaut ar in place some peopl us two kei a short on which is not carefulli manag for ordinari us and a longer on which is treat with greater care for critic correspond untrust partner attack ripem s encrypt will ensur that onli a person with the privat kei correspond to the public kei us to encrypt the data mai read the traffic howev onc someon with that kei get the messag she mai alwai make whatev kind of transform she wish there exist no cryptograph barrier to a recipi sai take an encrypt messag and convert it to a mic onli messag sign by you and readabl by anyon although ripem doe not provid thi function inde the latest pem draft i have seen specif state that such transform should be possibl to allow forward function to work includ the recipi in the plaintext as mention abov will make it possibl for recipi of a redistribut messag to be awar of it origin natur natur the secur of the cryptographi can never be greater than the secur of the peopl us it
