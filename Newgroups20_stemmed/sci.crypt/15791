subject re idea on clipper jim gillogli jim mycroft rand org write in articl fpizbg wc qokyw andrew cmu edu you write suppos i knew how the algorithm work and knew the n for my chip but did not know f then by cryptanalysi i might be abl to determin f from if law enforc field e e k u n f not know n would might make thi much harder thei re bet that you can t do thi even if you know n even if you know e in fact which thei re try to keep secret if you can find e by grind down the chip presum you can find f as well but we can t do thi right now with de even know the encrypt method without do almost the whole bit search that is not true with chosen plaintext attack de kei can be determin without the full search now suppos that i know f either legitim or not if i know k either becaus i am involv in the convers or i know u for a parti in the convers i mai now be abl to determin u for the other parti again thei re bet that you can t find u given k i e thei claim the encrypt is strong trust us i am not will to take that bet if i know f i can also defeat the law enforc field sinc i could make my own with a differ k then the on i am us know f also allow traffic analysi to be perform so i might not know what you ar sai but i could know who you ar sai it too i m not sure there ll be a wai to shove arbitrari kei and data through your chip but if so thi part s ok we re assum e is unknown you can obvious shove arbitrari data through your chip as for the kei it is state that the sesion kei exchang is extern to the chip so i can pick my kei too now i admit that someon try to comput u will not have lot of messag to work from but sinc we have no wai of know that the kei gener method doe not deliber gener weak kei or for that matter that the publish method is in fact us perhap the u s will be chosen from know weak kei for the system thei assum that you won t be abl to find u no matter how mani messag you have if thei could break u thei wouldn t need the kei escrow bing bing bing bing bing that exactli my point sinc we cant know that thei do not have thi capabl the onli safe assumpt is that thei do i admit that most of my cryptograph complaint ar probabl unfound but sinc we cant know on wai or the other im not gonig to take their word for it obvious the compromis of f would be a disast both to law enforc for whom thi whole thing is design and for the peopl who believ that it is give them secur f is but on number and i sure that alot of peopl more then know what it is and if some panel of expert is go to check it over for flaw then mani more will know f forget grind chip briberi and blackmail work just fine it s not clear that the expert will be told f in fact i d be surpris i d expect someth more of the form of the fip pub describ de so that thei could look at the algorithm in gener rather than with the specif set of kei chosen oh come on that like sai you could evalu de without the s box constant jon
