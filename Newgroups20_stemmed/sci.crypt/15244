content in mathemat term what is a privat kei cryptosystem what is an attack what s the advantag of formul all thi mathemat why is the on time pad secur what s a ciphertext onli attack what s a known plaintext attack what s a chosen plaintext attack in mathemat term what can you sai about brute forc attack what s a kei guess attack what s entropi in mathemat term what is a privat kei cryptosystem a privat kei cryptosystem consist of an encrypt system e and a decrypt system d the encrypt system e is a collect of function e k index by kei k map some set of plaintext p to some set of ciphertext c similarli the decrypt system d is a collect of function d k such that d k e k p p for everi plaintext p that is succes decrypt of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplish us the same kei index as wa us for the correspond encrypt of plaintext into ciphertext such system wherein the same kei valu is us to encrypt and decrypt ar also known as symmetr cryptoystem what is an attack in intuit term a passiv attack on a cryptosystem is ani method of start with some inform about plaintext and their correspond ciphertext under some unknown kei and figur out more inform about the plaintext it s possibl to state mathemat what thi mean here we go fix function f g and h of n variabl fix an encrypt system e and fix a distribut of plaintext and kei an attack on e us g assum f give h with probabl p is an algorithm a with a pair f g of input and on output h such that there is probabl p of comput h h p p n if we have f f p p n and g g e k p e k p n note that thi probabl depend on the distribut of the vector k p p n the attack is trivial or pointless if there is probabl at least p of comput h h p p n if f f p p n and g g c c n here c c n rang uniformli over the possibl ciphertext and have no particular relat to p p n in other word an attack is trivial if it doesn t actual us the encrypt e k p e k p n an attack is call on ciphertext if n two ciphertext if n and so on what s the advantag of formul all thi mathemat in basic cryptolog you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secur read part we keep sai a strong cryptosystem must have thi properti but have thi properti is no guarante that a cryptosystem is strong in contrast the purpos of mathemat cryptolog is to precis formul and if possibl prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong we sai for exampl that a cryptosystem is secur against all passiv attack if ani nontrivi attack against the system as defin abov is too slow to be practic if we can prove thi statement then we have confid that our cryptosystem will resist ani passiv cryptanalyt techniqu if we can reduc thi statement to some well known unsolv problem then we still have confid that the cryptosystem isn t easi to break other part of cryptolog ar also amen to mathemat definit again the point is to explicitli identifi what assumpt we re make and prove that thei produc the desir result we can figur out what it mean for a particular cryptosystem to be us properli it just mean that the assumpt ar valid the same methodolog is us for cryptanalysi too the cryptanalyst can take advantag of incorrect assumpt often he can try to construct a proof of secur for a system see where the proof fail and us these failur as the start point for hi analysi why is the on time pad secur by definit the on time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintext ciphertext and kei ar all string sai byte string of some length m and e k p is just the sum let s sai the exclus or of k and p it is easi to prove mathemat that there ar no nontrivi singl ciphertext attack on the on time pad assum a uniform distribut of kei note that we don t have to assum a uniform distribut of plaintext here s the proof let a be an attack i e an algorithm take two input f g and produc on output h with some probabl p that h h p whenev f f p and g g e k p i e g g k p then becaus the distribut of k is uniform and independ of p the distribut of k p must also be uniform and independ of p but also the distribut of c is uniform and independ of p henc there is probabl exactli p that h h p whenev f f p and g g c over all p and c thu a fortiori a is trivial on the other hand the on time pad is not secur if a kei k is us for more than on plaintext i e there ar nontrivi multipl ciphertext attack so to be properli us a kei k must be thrown awai after on encrypt the kei is also call a pad thi explain the name on time pad what s a ciphertext onli attack in the notat abov a ciphertext onli attack is on where f is constant given onli some inform g e k p e k p n about n ciphertext the attack ha to have some chanc of produc some inform h p p n about the plaintext the attack is trivial if it ha just as good a chanc of produc h p p n when given g c c n for random c c n for exampl sai g c c and sai h p is the first bit of p we can easili write down an attack the guess attack which simpli guess that h p is thi attack is trivial becaus it doesn t us the ciphertext it ha a fifti fifti chanc of guess correctli no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produc on bit of inform about p with success us c if it is fed a random c then the success rate drop to so thi is a nontrivi attack what s a known plaintext attack the classic known plaintext attack ha f p p p g c c c c and h p p depend onli on p in other word given two ciphertext c and c and on decrypt p the known plaintext attack should produc inform about the other decrypt p note that known plaintext attack ar often defin in the literatur as produc inform about the kei but thi is pointless the cryptanalyst gener care about the kei onli insofar as it let him decrypt further messag what s a chosen plaintext attack a chosen plaintext attack is the first of an increasingli impract seri of activ attack on a cryptosystem attack where the cryptanalyst feed data to the encryptor these attack don t fit into our model of passiv attack explain abov anywai a chosen plaintext attack let the cryptanalyst choos a plaintext and look at the correspond ciphertext then repeat until he ha figur out how to decrypt ani messag more absurd exampl of thi sort of attack ar the chosen kei attack and chosen system attack a much more import form of activ attack is a messag corrupt attack where the attack tri to chang the ciphertext in such a wai as to make a us chang in the plaintext there ar mani easi wai to throw kink into all of these attack for instanc automat encrypt ani plaintext p as t e k h t r p r p where t is a time kei sequenc number chosen anew for each messag r is a random number and h is a on wai hash function here comma mean concaten and plu mean exclus or in mathemat term what can you sai about brute forc attack consid the follow known plaintext attack we ar given some plaintext p p n and ciphertext c c n we re also given a ciphertext c n we run through everi kei k when we find k such that e k p i c i for everi i n we print d k c n if n is big enough that onli on kei work thi attack will succe on valid input all the time while it will produc correct result onli onc in a blue moon for random input thu thi is a nontrivi attack it onli problem is that it is veri slow if there ar mani possibl kei what s a kei guess attack what s entropi sai somebodi is us the on time pad but isn t choos kei randomli and uniformli from all m bit messag as he wa suppos to for our secur proof in fact sai he s known to prefer kei which ar english word then a cryptanalyst can run through all english word as possibl kei thi attack will often succe and it s much faster than a brute forc search of the entir keyspac we can measur how bad a kei distribut is by calcul it entropi thi number e is the number of real bit of inform of the kei a cryptanalyst will typic happen across the kei within e guess e is defin as the sum of p k log p k where p k is the probabl of kei k
