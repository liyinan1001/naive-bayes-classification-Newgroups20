subject re how doe it realli work wa re text of white hous announc and q as on clipper chip encrypt marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu write the main thing i just don t get is whether thi chip implement symmetr or asymmetr cryptograph techniqu anybodi know i don t know but i m as will to specul as anyon sever peopl have suggest that the chip us public kei cryptographi anoth possibl is to us diffi hellman kei exchang or some other algorithm which ha a similar effect dh allow both end to agre on a session kei which thei us with symmetr cryptographi someth like de for the encrypt how could the back door kei work in thi system i can see a few possibl on is that the dh like algorithm ha the properti that the session kei can be deduc by an eavesdropp who know the back door kei for on or possibl both communic perhap the random number us in the dh ar seed by the back door kei or some such anoth possibl as wa suggest here earlier is that the chip simpli broadcast the session kei encrypt with the chip s own intern secret kei in thi system the back door kei ar secret kei usabl for decrypt thi session kei broadcast actual the chip s secret kei doesn t need to be a public kei in thi usag but can be ident to the secret back door kei thi propos seem most straightforward to me still anoth possibl is that the encrypt algorithm us for the messag itself ha a dual kei properti that possess of either of two kei can be us to decrypt it on kei would be the session kei from the dh exchang and the other would be the back door kei for the chip it s worth note that on of the propos dorothi den rais dure her amazingli prescient on line discuss last novemb and decemb wa a variat on diffi hellman in which a third parti would particip in deriv the session kei thi doesn t quit fit into what we know of how clipper work but it hint that those who had earli knowledg of clipper or whose think wa somehow synchron with clipper design mai have had diffi hellman on their mind hal finnei
