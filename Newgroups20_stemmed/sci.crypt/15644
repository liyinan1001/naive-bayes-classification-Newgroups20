subject new encrypt as promis i spoke todai with the compani mention in a washington time articl about the clipper chip announc the name of the compani is secur communicatiion technolog inform will be given at the end of thi messag on how to contact them basic thei ar disturb about the announc for mani reason that we ar more specif howev mr bryen of secur commun brought to light mani point that might interest most of the reader hi belief is that at t wa made known of the clipper well befor the rest of the industri thi is for sever reason sever of which ar a compani of at t s size could never be abl to make a decis to us the new chip on the same dai it wa announc month ago thei propos us their own chip for at t s secur telephon devic at t basic blew them off as be not interest at all thi stuck them as strang until now also i spoke with art melnick their cryptograph he express sever concern over the new clipper chip the obviou backdoor will be abl to let mani peopl decrypt the code onc the kei is releas to author the secur of the crypto system is lost forev these kei can end up in the hand of ani agenc of the govern the fact that the escrow kei never chang mean that the algorithm is vulner over time to an attack the classifi algorithm mai hide anoth backdoor but he feel that it is probabl to keep peopl from forg fake serial number or chang the kei themselv addition he feel that the nsa ha probabl spent enough time and monei in work on a wai to keep thi chip from be revers engin that he feel that revers engin it will be veri difficult to do he feel that thei have develop a suitabl techniqu to protect the chip from thi attack also he feel that the chip is hardwar encod with the algorithm and not microcod onto the chip additon i spoke with mr melnick about their algorithm he couldn t tell me much about their new agorithm becaus it hasn t been patent yet howev he told me a littl the algorithm will be releas for public review after patent have been grant for it thi is so the crypto commun can see that it is secur the algorithm is call nea for new encrypt algorithm the detail were sketchi becaus now it is held as a trade secret until the patent wa issu but i wa told that it will incorpor the follow it will have fast encrypt of data exact spec not given but mr melnick state much faster than what an rs can put out it is a symmetr cipher just like idea and de it will us bit data block for encrypt like de and idea the kei length wa not given to me but mr melnick state that it is adujust and is more than adequ for secur the algorithm is written in c and assembl in softwar form and can be port to mani platform unlik the the clipper chip which is hardwar onli and cannot be made into softwar thi i consid a definit plu for the nea for widespread us the algorithm will accomod public kei distribut techniqu such as rsa or diffi hellman thi will also be support in the hardwar chip right now the project cost of the nea chip will be about dollar for each clipper will run each chip that is if it is produc enough which probabl won t happen thei current sell a program call c com that us the algorithm and a special stream protocol that doe not divid the encrypt data into block thi could prevent plaintext attack if you know what the block header is thi program oper at all support rs speed and us the softwar implement of the algorithm most importantli it doe not have a backdoor right now the compani is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of busi thi is a veri real possibl so thei realli need help in stop the clipper chip from becom a standard if you want to contact them thei can be reach at secur commun technolog georgia av suit silver spring md i talk to mr bryen who repres the compani he can answer ani question you have ani factual error occur in thi write up ar my own and i apolog for them ahead of time psionic wam umd edu fight the wiretap chip ask me how c craig h rowland amiga pgp kei avail those who would give up liberti for by request secur deserv neither a
