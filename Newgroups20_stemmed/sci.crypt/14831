subject ripem frequent ask question archiv name ripem faq last updat mar about thi post thi is a list of like question and inform about ripem a program for public kei mail encrypt it thi faq not ripem wa written and will be maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu it will be post to a varieti of newsgroup on a monthli basi follow up discuss specif to ripem is redirect to the group alt secur ripem what s new i am now run a world wide web archiv of ripem inform it doe not contain much of anyth that isn t avail elsewher but it ha conveni pointer to the most current version of thi faq and some other stuff the url is http cs indiana edu ripem dir html thi month s version ha a fair amount of new pointer to inform on patent and stuff like that i ve also reorder a few thing to have a more sensibl order i hope i don t have to edit thi again soon disclaim noth in thi faq should be consid legal advic or anyth other than on layperson s opinion if you want real legal advic talk to a real lawyer prefer on with experi in patent law export regul or whatev area of law is in question list of question what is ripem how can i get ripem will ripem run on my machin will ripem work with my mailer what is rsa what is de what is a fingerprint like md what is pem what s thi about distribut and authent kei isn t it a bad idea to us patent algorithm in standard like pem what about rsadsi pkp why do all ripem public kei look veri similar what is pgp what about rpem what is mime what is ti pem i have thi simpl wai to defeat the secur of ripem question and answer what is ripem ripem is a not yet complet but us implement of privaci enhanc mail pem ripem allow your electron mail to have the four secur facil provid by pem disclosur protect option origin authent messag integr measur and non repudi of origin alwai see what is pem ripem wa written primarili by mark riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routin which ar a librari call rsaref licens from rsa data secur inc the current version of ripem is the current version of the macintosh port of ripem is how can i get ripem ripem us the librari of cryptograph routin rsaref which is consid munit and thu is export restrict from distribut to person who ar not citizen or perman resid in the u s or canada without an export licens no such licens ha been obtain nor would on like be grant unless the rsa kei exchang were shorten to bit and the symmetr cipher chang to someth weaker than de there ar some suggest that thi situat mai chang now that clinton is in offic the author request in the readm file that thi law not be violat pleas do not export the cryptograph code in thi distribut outsid of the usa or canada thi is a person request from me the author of ripem and a condit of your us of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain and a licens for it is includ with the distribut you should read it befor us ripem ripem is avail via anonym ftp to citizen and perman resid in the u s from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readm file for info note that the non rsaref portion of ripem is not a product of rsa data secur incorpor thei mere ar help distribut it ripem as well as some other crypt stuff ha it home site on ripem msu edu which is open to non anonym ftp for user in the u s and canada who ar citizen or perman resid to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file get access for conveni binari for mani architectur ar avail here in addit to the full sourc tree will ripem run on my machin probabl it ha alreadi been port to ms do and most flavor of unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port to macintosh includ a standard unix style port and a rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau author of stuffit more port ar expect and help of user is invit will ripem work with my mailer probabl how easi and clean the effect interfac is will depend on the sophist and modular of the mailer though the user guid includ with the distribut discuss wai to us ripem with mani popular mailer includ berkelei mush elm and mh code is also includ in elisp to allow easi us of ripem insid gnu emac if you make a new interfac for ripem or creat an improv on on in the distribut which you believ is conveni to us secur and mai be us to other feel free to post it to alt secur ripem what is rsa rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetr or public kei thi mean that there ar two differ relat kei on to encrypt and on to decrypt becaus on cannot reason be deriv from the other you mai publish your encrypt or public kei wide and keep your decrypt or privat kei to yourself anyon can us your public kei to encrypt a messag but onli you hold the privat kei need to decrypt it note that the messag sent with rsa is normal just the de kei to the real plaintext see what is de note that the abov onli provid for disclosur protect for origin authent messag integr and non repudi of origin servic to be implement the fingerprint of the messag see what is a fingerprint like md is encrypt with the sender s privat kei the recipi or a disput resolv author can us the sender s public kei to decrypt it and confirm that the messag must have come from the sender and wa not alter rsa wa name for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invent it to find out lot more about rsa and modern cryptographi in gener ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq some inform also mai be in sci crypt what is de de is the data encrypt standard a wide us symmetr or secret kei crypto system unlik rsa de us the same kei to encrypt and decrypt messag howev de is much faster than rsa ripem us both de and rsa it gener a random kei and encrypt your mail with de us that kei it then encrypt that kei with the recipi s public rsa kei and includ the result in the letter allow the recipi to recov the de kei de is sometim consid weak becaus it is somewhat old and us a kei length consid too short by modern standard howev it should be reason safe against an oppon smaller than a larg corpor or govern agenc it is not like that the pem standard will incorpor support for other symmetr cipher in the near futur becaus there is a strong feel that pem should be stabl so it can becom util wide without earli problem with interoper what is a fingerprint like md md is a messag digest algorithm produc by rsa data secur inc it provid a bit fingerprint or cryptograph secur hash of the plaintext it is cryptograph secur becaus it is not possibl in a reason amount of comput to produc a differ plaintext which produc the same fingerprint thu instead of sign the entir messag with the sender s privat kei onli the md of the messag need to be sign for authent md s can also be exchang directli for authent for exampl ripem public kei includ an md of the public kei in the file so parti wish to confirm their kei ar authent via a separ channel mere need exchang md s of kei and verifi their accuraci md is sometim us for other purpos for exampl it is often us to map an input of arbitrari length to bit of data as a passphras interpret or cooki gener md is describ in it entireti includ an implement in c in rfc there have been some recent suggest that md mai not be as strong a hash as wa origin believ presum some other hash function will be us if thi is accept as true what is pem pem is privaci enhanc mail a standard for allow transfer of encrypt electron mail gener over a long period of time by a work group of expert it is describ in rfc these document have been approv and obsolet the old rfc ripem is not realli a complet implement of pem becaus pem specifi certif for authent kei which ripem doe not handl at thi time their addit is plan what s thi about distribut and authent kei for a remot user to be abl to send secur mail to you she must know your public kei for you to be abl to confirm that the messag receiv came from her you must know her public kei it is import that thi inform be accur if a bad gui convinc her that hi kei is in fact your she will send messag which he can read ripem allow for three method of kei manag a central server the distribut finger server and a flat file all three ar describ in the ripem user guid which is part of the distribut none of them provid perfect secur the pem standard call for kei manag by certif the addit of thi featur to ripem is plan but chicken egg issu still exist isn t it a bad idea to us patent algorithm in standard like pem thi issu ha been consid in the standard process rfc the specif for internet standard ha a discuss section on what specif for nondiscriminatori avail must be met for a patent method to be includ in a standard rfc address thi issu with regard to the patent cover public kei cryptographi thi doe not of cours mean that all question ar settl or that everyon is in agreement an interest exchang on the us of patent algorithm in standard with regard to public kei cryptographi is in the leagu for program freedom archiv avail via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf in the file bidzo letter and bidzo respons amusingli the lpf file on ftp uu net ar compress with a patent algorithm what about rsadsi pkp rsa data secur inc rsadsi is a california base compani special in cryptograph technolog public kei partner is a firm which hold exclus sub licens right of the follow u s patent and all of their correspond foreign patent cryptograph apparatu and method diffi hellman no public kei cryptograph apparatu and method hellman merkl no cryptograph commun system and method rsa no exponenti cryptograph apparatu and method hellman pohlig no pkp claim these four patent cover all known method of public kei cryptographi the two busi ar rather close relat for exampl the same person jim bidzo is presid of both of them pkp ha licens thi technolog to a consider number of compani ibm dec motorola at t lotu for us in their product pkp ha also threaten and file lawsuit defend their patent ripem wa origin creat with no connect to rsadsi other than it us of the rsaref librari and for no reason other than it author s desir to see widespread us of public kei cryptographi howev after the ball start roll peopl at rsadsi got interest rsadsi decid to carri ripem on it ftp site and some peopl there start make their own ripem kei and contribut code ripem even won the best applic built on rsaref in award why do all ripem public kei look veri similar ripem public kei begin with a pkc public kei cryptographi standard identifi describ variou characterist about the kei so the first bunch of charact in your kei mai be the same as those of lot of other peopl s kei thi doe not mean your kei ar similar but onli that thei ar the same class of kei were gener with the same program ar of the same length etc what is pgp pgp is anoth cryptograph mail program call pretti good privaci pgp ha been around longer than ripem and work somewhat differ pgp is not compat with ripem in ani wai though pgp doe also us rsa a few major differ between pgp and ripem pgp ha more kei manag featur particularli for user without a direct network connect ripem conform to the pem rfc and thu ha a greater probabl of work with other pem softwar pgp make no attempt to be compat with anyth other than itself ripem us rsaref a librari of rsa routin from rsadsi which come with a licens allow noncommerci us pgp us it own implement of rsa pkp claim that it is a violat of it patent to make us or sell pgp in the u s or canada without either a licens or written permiss see disclaim see what about rsadsi pkp phil zimmermann the author of pgp stop distribut it after be threaten with legal action he believ that a licens scheme could be arrang but it hasn t happen and there seem littl prospect of it happen in the futur he acknowledg in the pgp user s guid in fact if you live in the usa and you ar not a feder agenc you shouldn t actual run pgp on your comput becaus public kei partner want to forbid you from run my softwar pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem ar export restrict and cannot be sent outsid the u s and canada without an export licens howev pgp alreadi exist on mani ftp site in europ and other place whether you us pgp or ripem or whatev the document to pgp is recommend read to anyon interest in such issu unfortun it s not distribut separ from the program which can be difficult to find in the u s on ftp site due to liabil concern what about rpem rpem stand for rabin privaci enhanc mail it wa similar to ripem but us a public kei cipher invent by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on public kei system it wa written by mark riordan who later wrote ripem it distribut wa halt when contrari to the belief of mani includ rabin pkp claim that their patent were broad enough to cover the cipher emploi thi claim is not univers accept but wa not challeng for pragmat reason rpem is not realli us anymor it is not compat with ripem or pgp what is mime mime stand for multipurpos internet mail extens and is describ in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime a faq exist on it how pem should interact with mime is not yet entir clear some peopl us the stopgap solut of have a mime type applic x ripem in order to send ripem messag as mime on i hope some standard will emerg draft internet document exist on the matter what is ti pem trust inform system is work on a version of privaci enhanc mail for gener avail last i heard it wa rumor to be integr into an exist mail user agent mh rather than a stand alon system and in beta test i don t know much more than that i have thi simpl wai to defeat the secur of ripem you mai wish to check the companion post ripem attack which discuss some of the more obviou attack on ripem s secur and what procedur will minim the risk ripem s main weak area is probabl kei distribut
