subject re invent crypto polici an eff statement april initi eff analysi of clinton privaci and secur propos the clinton administr todai made a major announc on cryptographi polici which will effect the privaci and secur of million of american the first part of the plan is to begin a comprehens inquiri into major commun privaci issu such as export control which have effect deni most peopl easi access to robust encrypt and law enforc issu pose by new technolog howev eff is veri concern that the administr ha alreadi reach a conclus on on critic part of the inquiri befor ani public comment or

split kei escrow encrypt scheme which will be built into chip manufactur by a militari contractor two separ escrow agent would store user kei and be requir to turn them over law enforc upon present of a valid warrant the encrypt scheme us is to be classifi but the chip will be avail to ani manufactur for incorpor into it commun product thi propos rais a number of seriou concern first the administr ha adopt a solut befor conduct an inquiri the nsa develop clipper chip mai not be the most secur product other vendor or develop mai have better scheme furthermor we should not reli on the govern as the sole sourc for the clipper or ani other chip rather independ chip manufactur should be abl to produc chipset base on open standard second an algorithm cannot be trust unless it can be test yet the administr propos to keep the chip algorithm classifi eff believ that ani standard adopt ought to be public and open the public will onli have confid in the secur of a standard that is open to independ expert scrutini third while the us of the us of a split kei dual escrow system mai prove to be a reason balanc between privaci and law enforc need the detail of thi scheme must be explor publicli

classifi algorithm and the possibl of back door the administr claim that there ar no back door mean by which the govern or other could break the code without secur kei from the escrow agent and that the presid will be told there ar no back door to thi classifi algorithm in order to prove thi administr sourc ar interest in arrang for an all star crypto cracker team to come in under a secur arrang and examin the algorithm for trap door the result of the investig would then be made public the clipper chipset wa design and is be produc and a sole sourc secret contract between the nation secur
