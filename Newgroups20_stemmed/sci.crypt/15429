subject re clipper chip long follow up in articl rand org jim rand org jim gillogli write thi document is in the anonym ftp directori at nist look to me like the other shoe ha drop jim gillogli trewesdai astron s r thank for post thi and make it avail thi post will be long i will comment on most of it and am reluctantli leav all of the origin in place to provid context pleas note that an alt group ha been set up for the clipper stuff note thi file will also be avail via anonym file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directori pub nistnew and via the nist comput secur bb at the white hous offic of the press secretari for immedi releas april statement by the press secretari the presid todai announc a new initi that will bring the feder govern togeth with industri in a voluntari hum at t vlsi and mykotronx ar industri wonder what happen to ibm thi should be right up their street and a mandate scheme is voluntari mr orwel would love thi program to improv the secur and privaci of telephon commun while meet the legitim need of law enforc telephon encrypt and scrambl ar year behind digit on like rsa idea or even de the abov while literali true is a clasic straw man claim in the context of non real time circuit such as e mail and the like the initi will involv the creation of new product to acceler the develop and us of advanc and secur telecommun network and wireless commun link i would modestli propos that a mandat us of isdn would do more for commun icat than thi lot for too long there ha been littl or no dialogu between our privat sector and the law enforc commun to resolv the tension between econom vital and the real challeng of protect american rather than us technolog to accommod the sometim compet interest of econom growth privaci and law enforc previou polici have pit govern against industri and the right of privaci against law enforc sophist encrypt technolog ha been us for year to protect electron fund transfer it is now be us to protect electron mail and comput file while encrypt normmali de technolog can help american protect busi secret and the unauthor releas of person inform it also can be us by terrorist drug dealer and other crimin note the us of the word busi in the abov the whole tenor of thi releas seem to be establish a ground rule that onli busi us is legitim for debat if you want the noth you drop in your wife s ear to remain secret and privat that is not even on the agenda for debat note that there is no role for you to contain privat info in thi the onli refer is to inform alreadi in the hand of other the unauthor releas bit is also draw a long bow most of these case ar by peopl who have legitim access abus it and reveal or often sell the info these peopl ar of cours in thi propos the peopl who will have the kei the crimin also us lawer court the cia white hous offici and pen to go about their busi when will thei be outlaw as well yeah sever of them would be a better idea than clipper them again the protect of law and the court have been serious errod over the last decad ofr so a state of the art microcircuit call the clipper chip ha been develop by govern engin the chip repres a nsa new approach to encrypt technolog yeah thi bit is veri true it can be us in new rel inexpens encrypt devic that can be attach to an ordinari telephon it scrambl telephon commun us an encrypt algorithm that is more power than mani in commerci us todai note the repeat mix of telephon scrabel and encrypt a demo of the abov claim on an ordanari pot would be a good night entertain i suspect note also the mani not all as the gener tone impli thi new technolog will help compani protect proprietari inform protect the privaci of person phone convers and prevent unauthor releas of data transmit electron at the same time thi technolog preserv the abil of feder state and local law enforc agenc to intercept lawfulli the phone convers of crimin the case record seem to indic that what is need is a brutal tighten of the current abus i have not heard yet of a case that wa impead by the us of secur encrypt by the men in black the other side abus by law enforc is well document even by govt agenc and the phone vs other com is blur yet again a kei escrow system will be establish to ensur that the clipper chip is us to protect the privaci of law abid american a kei escrow system will be establish to ensur that the clipper chip is us to protect the privaci of law abid american let run that line twice not veri carefulli what it sai the state purpos of the kei eschrow is to make the us of clipper compulsori note the word ensur as to protect or law abid i will leav to you so to the person who ask if it includ the outlaw of other encrypt the answer in thi press releas is ye each devic contain the chip will have two uniqu kei number that will be need by author govern agenc to decod messag encod by the devic when the devic is manufactur the two kei will be deposit separ in two kei escrow data base that will be establish by the attornei gener access to these kei will be limit to govern offici with legal author to conduct a wiretap just as thei onli can wiretap now with a warrent the clipper chip technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american just make sure that the illeg on ar preserv to demonstr the effect of thi new technolog the attornei gener will soon purchas sever thousand of the new devic in addit respect expert from outsid the govern will be offer access to the confidenti detail of the algorithm to assess it capabl and publicli report their find where do you find mani expert ani ex kgb peopl look for a contract and as a later post ask what of the stu iii thei alreadi have it will be veri interest to see if the militari and us embasi start to us it after all it is secur isn t it the govt will answer that point by it own action the chip is an import step in address the problem of encrypt s dual edg sword encrypt help to protect the privaci of individu and industri but it also can shield crimin and terrorist we need the clipper chip and other approach that can both provid law abid citizen with access to the encrypt thei need and prevent crimin from us it to hide their illeg activ in order to assess technolog trend and explor new approach like the kei escrow system the presid ha direct govern agenc to develop a comprehens polici on encrypt that accommod the privaci of our citizen includ the need to emploi voic or data encrypt for busi purpos again person us seem to be a unask question the abil of author offici to access telephon call and data under proper court or other legal order when necessari to protect our citizen ah so warrent ar not alwai need it seem the effect and time us of the most modern technolog to build the nation inform infrastructur need to promot econom growth and the competit of american industri in the global marketplac and the need of u s compani to manufactur and export high technolog product the itar seem to slightli impe thi the presid ha direct earli and frequent consult with affect industri the congress and group that advoc the privaci right of individu as polici option ar develop the administr is commit to work with the privat sector to spur the develop of a nation inform infrastructur which will us new telecommun and comput technolog to give american unpreced access to inform thi infrastructur of high speed network inform superhighwai will transmit video imag hdtv program and huge data file as easili as todai s telephon system transmit voic note that all thi wonderful stuff will be in secret onli the proper peopl will be abl to express an opinion henc onli the desir result will emerg sinc encrypt technolog will plai an increasingli import role in that infrastructur the feder govern must act quickli to develop consist comprehens polici regard it us the administr is commit to polici that protect all american right to privaci while also protect them from those who break the law encrypt and code have been around for millenia thei ar generali in equilibrium with the technolog of the time the systemat studi of cypher ha result in a swing in favor of the encrypt at the moment i have no doubt that the factor problem will fall in time probabl fofr practic purpos by the middl of the next centuri further inform is provid in an accompani fact sheet the provis of the presid s direct to acquir the new encrypt technolog ar also avail for addit detail call mat heyman nation institut of standard and technolog question and answer about the clinton administr s telecommun initi q doe thi approach expand the author of govern agenc to listen in on phone convers a no clipper chip technolog provid law enforc with no new author to access the content of the privat convers of american q suppos a law enforc agenc is conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggl ring and intercept a convers encrypt us the devic what would thei have to do to deciph the messag a thei would have to obtain legal author normal a court order to do the wiretap in the first place thei would then present document of thi author to the two entiti respons for safeguard the kei and obtain the kei for the devic be us by the drug smuggler the kei is split into two part which ar store separ in order to ensur the secur of the kei escrow system q who will run the kei escrow data bank a the two kei escrow data bank will be run by two independ entiti at thi point the depart of justic and the administr have yet to determin which agenc will overse the kei escrow data bank it is a littl hard to critisis a non propos q how strong is the secur in the devic how can i be sure how strong the secur is a thi system is more secur than mani other voic encrypt system readili avail todai note we drop back to phone mode again if thi is a true answer it can be rephras as it suck big time anyon who can drive the crypt work bench will us it for light amus befor breakfast while the algorithm will remain classifi to protect the secur of the kei escrow system thi link between the secur of the kei eschrow and the actual algorithm is a real winner given that i have secret bit number could someon pleas explain how the detail of an encrypt algorithm will reveal them we ar will to invit an independ panel of cryptographi expert to evalu the algorithm to assur all potenti user that there ar no unrecogn vulner just make sure you read the cv real carfulli ok q whose decis wa it to propos thi product a the nation secur council the justic depart the commerc depart and other kei agenc were involv in thi decis thi approach ha been endors by the presid the vice presid and appropri cabinet offici quick with out look back what name is miss from that list q who wa consult the congress industri a we have on go discuss with congress and industri on encrypt issu and expect those discuss to intensifi as we carri out our review of encrypt polici we have brief member of congress and industri leader on the decis relat to thi initi the peopl who agre with us and who think there is a buck in it for them q will the govern provid the hardwar to manufactur a the govern design and develop the kei access encrypt microcircuit but it is not provid the microcircuit to product manufactur product manufactur can acquir the microcircuit from the chip manufactur that produc them the revers engin provis of the mask work act could be relev here q who provid the clipper chip a mykotronx program it at their facil in torranc california and will sell the chip to encrypt devic manufactur the program function could be licens to other vendor in the futur q how do i bui on of these encrypt devic a we expect sever manufactur to consid incorpor the clipper chip into their devic you don t not unless you ar on of the right peopl q if the administr were unabl to find a technolog solut like the on propos would the administr be will to us legal remedi to restrict access to more power encrypt devic a thi is a fundament polici question which will be consid dure the broad polici review the kei escrow thei miss the word secret here he need a grammar lesson too mechan will provid american with an encrypt product that is more secur more conveni and less expens than other readili avail todai but it is just on piec of what must be the comprehens approach to encrypt technolog which the administr is develop i would sai less secur less conveni more expens pgp is free less avail and more prone to be comprimis proof to the contarari will be welcom note proof the administr is not sai sinc encrypt threaten the public safeti and effect law enforc we will prohibit it outright as some countri have effect done nor is the u s sai that everi american as a matter of right is entitl to an unbreak commerci encrypt product thei don t seem to be sai anyth that make much sens and thi propos doe prohibit it except in a veri limit wai and thi is the on explicit refer to person right it is a denial and ye i don t think that the mexican brazilian and canuck ar includ in clinton et al magnanam gestur there is a fals tension creat in the assess that thi issu is an either or proposit rather both concern can be and in fact ar harmoni balanc through a reason balanc approach such as is propos with the clipper chip and similar encrypt techniqu the fals tension is fals the balanc is between two repugn point the right to privaci is hand wave to non exist by put it behind the fals assess it is assum that the remov of the right to take what ever step you deem suitabl to protect your privaci is non negoti henc is defin in the goven languag to be non exist if you don t agre you must be a crimin as onli crimin don t agre with out law also note the non question if what is here wa not possibl q what doe thi decis indic about how the clinton administr s polici toward encrypt will differ from that of the bush administr a it indic that we understand the import of encrypt technolog in telecommun and comput and ar commit to work with industri and public interest group to find innov wai to protect american privaci help busi to compet and ensur that law enforc agenc have the tool thei need to fight crime and terror it indic we know that bush drop the ball in squash that nasti insert suitabl retor and will stamp out thi disorderli unrulei outbreak of freedom and ultra nation sentiment q will the devic be export will other devic that us the govern hardwar a voic encrypt devic ar subject to export control requir case by case review for each export is requir to ensur appropri us of these devic the same is true for other encrypt devic on of the attract of thi technolog is the protect it can give to u s compani oper at home and abroad with thi in mind we expect export licens will be grant on a case by case basi for u s compani seek to us these devic to secur their own commun abroad we plan to review the possibl of permit wider export of these product thi on is a real giggl in australia or franc thei will have to reveal the kei and the algorithm don t think it s at the top of my list of thing i must have so the restrict will protect me from salek try to sell me a bill of crock ani for ani other us it thei must be nut good luck folk paul
