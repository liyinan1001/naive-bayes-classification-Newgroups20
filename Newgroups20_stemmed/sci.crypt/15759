subject re new encrypt from den guvax acc georgetown edu the clipper chip a technic summari dorothi den revis april the chip ar program by mykotronx inc which call them the myk the silicon is suppli by vlsi technolog inc all clipper chip ar program insid a scif secur compart inform facil which is essenti a vault the scif contain a laptop comput and equip to program the chip about chip ar program dure a singl session the scif is locat at mykotronx acknowledg and distribut notic thi articl is base on inform provid by nsa nist fbi and mykotronx permiss to distribut thi document is grant so who is mykotronx inc it would be nice to know that thei were not a front compani us by an intellig or other agenc of the u s govern trust the fox to guard the chicken and all that seem suspici when the rest of the sourc ar fox while we ar at it the chip design s should be examin and verifi against silicon to insur no trap door or hidden protocol exist in silicon regardless of the secur level of the encrypt algorithm it would be a shame if some three letter agenc had the abil to interrog my chip when all i d know is that someon rang and when i attempt to go off hook the line went dead could be even wors if the chip were intend to connect directli to a modem the design examin should be done to the gate level doe anyon have a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon the model would be extra logic share pin with the advertis function tip off would be circuitri that would ignor incom data if format or sequenc is not right i can think of onli two wai an output pin could be us and it possibl that might be notic but could be edit from the netlist i think the silicon itself need to be investig imagin a design done in two layer metal yet find a third layer under the microscop the govern is ask for a lot of blind trust the encrypt algorithm oper protocol the agenc have physic control of the devic the silicon implement i d feel like keep on hand on my wallet
