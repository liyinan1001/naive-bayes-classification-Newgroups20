subject re onc tap your code is no good ani more in articl apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton write in articl tcmayc m xv jex netcom com tcmai netcom com timothi c mai write get the court order to reveal the kei also make decipher all past convers which mai be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the propos i could be wrong but i ve seen no mention of session kei be the escrow entiti true in theori in practic the technolog of cellular phone will probabl be spread spectrum and quit difficult to record the crypttext without the kei if the frequenc path depend on thei kei as i understand it to it could be made effect imposs to record i am not an expert in the cryptographi scienc but some basic thing seem evid to me thing which thi clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunit for abus and conclus base on what i have seen the membership of thi group except for two notabl person agre to if anyth bad is possibl by the govern in theori it almost alwai end up happen in fact so the kei is to make abus imposs question author and rememb power doe corrupt i think on ha to regard thi whole idea in the sens that it will be expand to includ other data form such as data transfer and store data and as such should be treat as if it were expand or such expans will be almost imposs to stop us clipper as a precid there wa a hint of that in the propos rememb that said pleas bear with me i am not veri articul so i take more word to sai what other could sai much more briefli thank you onc it hit land you can record it if you have telco access the telco isn t suppos to give that without a warrant that s the rule todai as i suggest thi is now the hint is in the propos that thi or similar propos ar be consid for other form of encrypt such as data transfer data file and such larg depend on how thi thing is accept or fli i think on would be wise to treat thi in the manner on would when not if it get expand to other area than cellular phone i think thi is guarante to happen if thi propos get by salami polit it ha been and is us in sever other area it is certain to be us here govern is not go to easili give up on the idea that thei should be abl to eavesedrop whenev thei want to court order requir ha proven to be a rather flimsi guarante if the case warrant thei can alwai siez the materi and forc on to give the kei or sit in jail forev on period renew contempt charg so it is not deni the justic system the inform nor the abil to lock someon up if guilti or refus to divulg the mean to access the info thi is not protect under the fifth on can be forc to perform act that would result in divulg incrimin evid so block restrict on privat encrypt is not prevent legitim law enforc it doe make illegitim law enforc a bunch more difficult especi fish expedit without the target s knowleg don t give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negoti and clinton and co know it which is probabl why thei quietli develop thi thing figur if thei get it thi far thei can ram it on through how come those consult could be roughli describ as us insid thei cannot quiet impliment it though when thei ban other scheme to ensur it exclus us henc the nice pr document to try and reassur everyon don t bui into it ha govern realli earn that kind of trust past or futur to be secur and free on must keep govern honest and the onli wai to do that is to make abus imposs not unlik or difficult but even so the evid would not be admiss i think unless the judg so order i think that even intercept of the crypttext without a warrant would be illeg cop can t record todai s plain cellular call and then ask a judg hei can we have permiss to listen to those tape can thei so what on could us inform gain by re us of the kei save after the last case wa finish or other mean master kei backdoor easili broken algorithm to find other evid which given to a judg would author a tap which wouldn t have been possibl otherwis thi ha been the more common manner of abus of wiretap in the past for local cop thi might be workabl to keep them honest but the fed have a workaround somehow bet on it doe anyon realli believ for exampl that the govern will us a scheme nsa cannot listen in on scan for keyword either easili defeat in realtim or via a master kei i sure don t thi whole thing sound like someth to elimin the need to us old fashion polic work to build a case in the past eavesdrop wa rather easi with or without a court order i think the law enforc commun ha becom a bit spoil and will resist chang that requir them to revert to us old fashion detect work i just find it somewhat surpris come from a bunch that care so much about civil and individu right that put peopl first the question is put peopl first to where with the innard not be reveal how is on to be sure there doesn t exist a master kei for us by nsa etc so thei can do their keyword scan etc on convers thei routin monitor without a specif court order rememb the cellular phone limiti is onli temporari bet on it and so far i have not heard about polic tell peopl that thei have been tap and noth incrimin wa found what is to keep them from simpli keep the kei on file for next time after awhil thei would have quit a collect kept especi for folk thei deem disrupt and if thei get onli on kei that would reduc the search space a lot unless it is an rsa scheme rememb nixon year need for court order realli slow them down didn t it and unless the escrow account ar not govern control fat chanc i see on end up be under sai treasuri the other under justic it could be worth some seriou buck to some folk to get kei to a competitor s clinton clipper or descend when thi idea is expand to be us for all non govern encrypt enough buck would get on the kei or the innard for thi algorithm perhap not an import concern but given past govern behavior and the other problem wors of cours if the govern then us thi clinton clipper to argu for restrict on unapprov encrypt thi is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc ye that is a major concern but i think that thei think thei can win just by have of the usa us thi system thei don t even have to care about the cautiou that s left thei don t catch the realli smart crook anywai john gotti who would have to be retard not to realiz he wa like to be wiretap glibli chat awai on hi tap phone about murder plan that s why he s in jail now hard to believ but true what will on do when it is expand to data storag encrypt you can bet that if clipper is accept that will be next on the agenda it is even hint at in the propos read it carefulli expect the argumet well if you got noth to hide fine then us that argument on should not object to video camera be instal in everi room of on s home grant an extem expans of the idea but the principl hold privat stuff should remain privat even from a govt fish expedit and law rule mai chang in the futur as to safeguard when it come to the fed govern safeguard ar pretti meaningless if thei want to do get someth don t work so hard to give up some rather treasur right or establish bad precid pleas the price could be hell to pai later thi scheme can succe without law forbid more which peopl would fight a lot harder thei like thi enough that thei ar drop the so call digit telephoni propos accord to rumour howev the mean of that is complex sinc thei still want to get at the crypttext on telco system and that requir a bit of work peopl would fight law forbid more now but in sai two year becaus we have thi crisi situat which must be address by some drastic action just thi ad reason restrict will onli bother those who have somet to hide etc pleas don t bui into it if the clinton clipper is so veri good why not make it algrithm public so mani peopl can exchang idea and examin it rather than a few isol respect expert respect by whom for what perhap a certain professor who like kei bank would be on of the select expert thi doe seem to expand on some idea the person wa advoc if i recal how would anybodi know that what the expert examin is the same as what will end up be us in the clipper chip if it is kept secret perhap the clipper will us a crippl version with a master kei provis or featur not present in the version subject for studi and evalu by the expert and who choos the expert the govern no conflict of interest there and isn t it a requir for ani decent encrypt scheme that it not have it effect reduc by have the algrorithm wide known i wa lead to believ that on should assum the other side ha everyth you have except for the kei s i recal idea present to thi group ar reject if a requir exist the algorithm be secret anoth question sinc it is a safe bet thi clipper thing would not be us for govern secur thei ar regard it as not real secur but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see a full descript not a pr non statement of just what good enough mean i think when sai how strong it is good enough realli mean not veri the excus that other countri have these restrict is not accept other countri do not have our bill of right and constitut which the peopl not the govern of those other countri often regard with envi what we have as right thei have as revok privileg and if we expect to retain those right and protect we must not allow them to be gut becaus we just gotta have thi thing to fight crime we have allreadi have our bill of right pretti much torn to shred we should not permit more weakin for yet anoth nobl caus instead we should be try to repair the damag our crime problem mai have a number of caus but too mani right and safeguard is not a signifig on a broken court system and poor polic work ar a much more signifig caus as have too mani right disregard address the root caus for crime etc btw those who suggest that thi is just an attack on clinton believ thi i would be go ballist reagardless who serious propos thi thing it is just anoth step in a gradual eros of our right under the constitut or bill of right the last coupl of decad have been a non stop seri of end run around the protect of the constitut it ha to stop now is as good a time as ani if it isn t too late allreadi
