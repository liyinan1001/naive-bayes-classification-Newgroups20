subject clipper some new thought i d despar prefer it if we didn t rehash the same argument that went on ad infinitum last time that s especi true for sci crypt for that matter i ve creat alt privaci clipper sinc the traffic is appear in mani differ group right now i m go to focu here on some technic aspect of the plan henc my followup to sci crypt frankli if you re not an absolutist your feel mai turn on some of these issu for exampl with an bit kei simpli split it into two bit piec is much less accept than other scheme becaus it mean that if just on repositori is shall we sai overli pliabl a would be eavesdropp would need to recov just more bit of kei i need not point out in thi newsgroup that that s pretti easi to do by exhaust search a slightli more complex scheme xor ing the kei with a random number and then with it complement would produc two bit subkei neither of which is us alon that variant is much more resist to attack clearli on can get even more sophist to protect the subkei even more other thought some peopl have note the size and complex of the databas necessari but the id string the phone emit could be their back door kei doubl encrypt with the escrow repositori public kei for that matter thei could do that onli with session kei and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have to bring everi intercept to the repositori to be decrypt thi would answer mani of the object along the line of how do you make sure thei stop we can even combin that with a variant of the digit telephoni back door have the switch do the tap but with a digit sign record of the time phone number etc of the call that provid proof to the escrow agent that the tap wa done in complianc with the term of the warrant i can suggest other variat too suppos each clipper chip had public kei pair each would be us time after which you d need more kei materi not a bad idea in ani event thi could be us to enforc time limit or rather usag limit on each warrant the kei the repositori agent would deliv wouldn t last for veri long i suspect that the cryptograph algorithm itself is secur apart from the obviou why push a weak algorithm when you ve alreadi got the back door i think that the govern is still genuin concern about foreign espionag especi aim at commerci target thi scheme let the spook have their cake and eat it too i ve heard rumor over the year that some faction within nsa were unhappi with de becaus it wa too good not that thei couldn t crack it but it wa much too expens to do so as easili as thei d want thei re keep the detail secret so that other don t build their own implement without the back door the cryptograph protocol though is anoth matter i see no valid reason for keep it secret and as i hope i ve shown abov there ar a lot of wai to do thing that aren t quit as bad
