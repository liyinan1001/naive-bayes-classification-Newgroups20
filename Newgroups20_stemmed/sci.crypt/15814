subject re clipper consid harm the clipper chip s user kei is form by r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s why is the tripl encryt us is it just to gain an effect increas in keyspac to defeat a potenti keysearch if so why us bit kei not know anyth about the skipjack algorithm it s not realli possibl to guess whether thi make it harder or easier to guess s s why ar n n and n form as thei ar it would be facin to see the skipjack algorithm to look for wai of attack it that requir three ciphertext block form in that odd wai where do the bit constant valu that ar concaten with the serial number to form n n n come from ar thei chang from chip to chip or session to session even if thei re publish in the ny time if skipjack is resist to known plaintext attack when us tripl encrypt then there s no break in secur but why allow that kind of weird format if those three bit valu ar truli random bit then mayb it s us to ensur that a known plaintext attack on skipjack if it exist can t be easili us to deriv s and s for a whole product run of these chip doe dorothi den read thi group if not is someon on the group forward question like these to her or martin hellman or anyon els who s seen more detail about the chip john kelsei
