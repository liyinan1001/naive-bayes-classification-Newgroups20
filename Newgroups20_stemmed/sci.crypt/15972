subject re s s steve b access digex com steve brinich write second question why why is such a strang procedur us and not a real rng thi turn those s s in a kind of bottleneck for system secur the onli theori that make ani sens is that s and s ar either the same for all chip or vari among veri few possibl so that anyon try to break the encrypt by brute forc need onli plow through the possibl serial number about on billion multipli by the number of differ s s combin my interpret of den s descript is that s and s ar chosen randomli by agent of the kei escrow compani at the start of each chip program session i imagin that the chip ar in a carrier which will allow them all to be program fairli quickli there would not be a need to transfer chip on at a time into a littl pla programm as some peopl have envis my guess as to why thi procedur is us is that base the kei on the s and s us a specifi algorithm provid an in principl checkabl wai to verifi that no back door exist in the choic of the random number us to gener the kei sinc we have to trust the escrow compani anywai it doe not weaken the system to have the kei be gener from random seed enter by the escrow agent and sinc the algorithm for kei gener is public modulo skipjack secreci then in principl an agent could challeng the procedur ask for s and s to be expos and run hi own independ calcul of u and u to verifi that that is what is actual be put onto the floppi and ye there ar mani wai in which failur to follow thi scheme could be hard to check the laptop probabl will not realli be destroi each time hidden camera in the ceil could see the s and s enter by the trust escrow agent back door in the chip could allow u to be recov heck each chip could be record with the same u ignor what wa on the floppi hal finnei
